name: ozone_depleting_emissions_since_1960_scientific_assessment_2014
description: "Figures represent emissions of ozone-depleting substances, with substances
    weighted by their potential to destroy ozone (their ozone-depleting potential).
    This gives a total value of emissions normalised to their CFC11-equivalents. \n\nTotal
    emissions is inclusive of naturally-occurring and man-made emissions.\n\nData
    is based on those in Q0-1 in 'Twenty questions and answers about the ozone layer:
    2014 update', published as the 2014 edition of the Scientific Assessment Panel
    of the Montreal Protocol.\n\nData was extracted from the static figure, Q0-1,
    using the extraction tool WebPlotDigitizer (https://apps.automeris.io/wpd/).\n"
