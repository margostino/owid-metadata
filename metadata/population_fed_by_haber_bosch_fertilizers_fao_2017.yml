description: "\r\n\tAdditional information: \r\nEstimates of population sustained
    with and without the production of Haber-Bosch nitrogen are derived based on Figure
    1 in Erisman et al. (2008) and its sources.\r\nWorld population figures were sourced
    from Gapminder for the years 1900-1949, and from the UN Population Division from
    1950 onwards.\r\nThe share of the world's population reliant on Haber-Bosch fertilizer
    production for food production was estimated based on Figure 1 in Erisman et al.
    (2008). These figures are based on approximation, although coincide with several
    published projections of these estimates. Erisman et al. estimate that by 2000,
    44% of the global population were sustained by Haber-Bosch nitrogen, rising to
    48% by 2008. This approximately coincides with Smil (2002) estimates of 40% by
    2000. OWID have extrapolated these estimates to 2015, assuming that approximately
    50% (Â±2%) rely on Haber-Bosch nitrogen.\r\nErisman, J. W., Sutton, M. A., Galloway,
