description: "Data on the number of hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean, and
    Gulf of Mexico, in addition to the number that made landfall in the United States,
    as published in the HURDAT (Hurricane Database) of the National Oceanic & Atmospheric
    Administration (NOAA).\n\nThis data runs from 1851 through to the latest annual
    data.\n\nHurricanes are categorised by the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale
    (SSHWS) which classifies by five categories (1 being the lowest; 5 the highest)
    based on the intensity of sustained winds. This scale estimates potential property
    damage. \n\nMajor hurricanes are defined as those with a 3, 4 or 5 rating on the
    SSHWS; these are considered major hurricanes because of their potential for significant
    loss of life and damage.\n\nThe NOAA notes that because of the sparseness of towns
    and cities before 1900 in some coastal locations along the United States, the
    data prior to 1900 may not be complete for all states.\n\n\"ACE\" is an abbreviation
    for \"Accumulated Cyclone Energy\". ACE is an index that combines the numbers
    of systems, how long they existed and how intense they became. It is calculated
    by squaring the maximum sustained surface wind in the system every six hours that
    the cyclone is a Named Storm and summing it up for the season.\n\nThe Power Dissipation
    Index (PDI) accounts for cyclone strength, duration, and frequency. he lines have
    been smoothed using a five-year weighted average, plotted at the middle year.
    The most recent average (2011–2015) is plotted at 2013."
