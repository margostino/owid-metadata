description: "Total greenhouse gas emissions in CO2 equivalent are composed of CO2
    totals excluding short-cycle biomass burning (such as agricultural waste burning
    and Savannah burning) but including other biomass burning (such as forest fires,
    post-burn decay, peat fires and decay of drained peatlands), all anthropogenic
    CH4 sources, N2O sources and F-gases (HFCs, PFCs and SF6).\n\nFigures on per capita
    greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were calculated by Our World in Data based on total
    GHG emissions, and population data published in the World Bank, World Development
    Indicators. \n\nThe World Bank (WDI) publishes figures on annual GHG emissions
    by country, sourced from the European Commission, Joint Research Centre (JRC)/Netherlands
    Environmental Assessment Agency (PBL). And population data sourced from the UN
    World Population Prospects.\n\nPer capita GHG emissions per year was calculated
    by dividing total annual emissions by country by its population in the given year.\n\nPer
    capita GHG emissions per day was calculated by diving annual per capita figures
    by 365 (and converting from tonnes to kilograms by multiplying by 1000).\n\nThe
    World Bank, World Development Indicators can be sourced at: http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators\n\nThe
    original data from EDGAR can be sourced at: http://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/"
