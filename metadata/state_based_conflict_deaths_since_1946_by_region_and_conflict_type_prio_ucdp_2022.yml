description: "The UCDP Battle-related Deaths Dataset provides data on direct deaths
    arising from 'state-based' conflicts.  UCDP defines state-based armed conflict
    as: “a contested incompatibility that concerns government and/or territory where
    the use of armed force between two parties, of which at least one is the government
    of a state, results in at least 25 battle-related deaths in a calendar year.”\n\nBoth
    civilian and military deaths are included. Deaths due to disease or famine caused
    by conflict, as well as extra-judicial killings in custody, are excluded.\n\nThe
    data is organised by year and conflict. We aggregate this to provide total numbers
    of deaths each year, broken down by the conflict type and region. \nThis dataset
    runs from 1989 and aims to have global coverage over this period. Accordingly,
    we add a zero deaths observation for year-region-conflict type combinations that
    do appear in the dataset.\n\nThe labels for the conflict types we have used paraphrase
    UCDP/PRIO's technical definitions of 'Extrasystemic', 'Internal', 'Internationalised
    internal' and 'Interstate'.\n\nNote that in this dataset the location refers not
    (necessarily) to where fighting and deaths took place, but rather to the location
    of the 'incompatibility' between the participants that defines the conflict: usually
    the country or territory whose possession or governance is in dispute.\n\nTo extend
    the data back further in time we rely on the PRIO Battledeaths Datset, produced
    according to the same definitions and structure as the UCDP Battle-related Deaths
    Dataset. The PRIO data runs from 1946 to 2008 and is no longer maintained. We
    aggregated the PRIO data in the same way as the UCDP data, and then constructed
    a final joint series which consists of the PRIO data from 1946 to 1988 and the
    UCDP data from 1989 onwards.\n\n\n"
