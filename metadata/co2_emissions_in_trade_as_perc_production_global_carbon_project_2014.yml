description: Original data on production-based emissions, and emissions transfers
    in trade from Peters et al. (2012) via the Global Carbon Project (http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/16/data.htm)
    have been manipulated to calculate the emissions transfers as a percentage of
    production-based emissions, presented in this chart.
