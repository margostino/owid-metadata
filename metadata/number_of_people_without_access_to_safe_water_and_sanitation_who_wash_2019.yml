    Absolute numbers of people without access to safely managed drinking water and sanitation was calculated by Our World in Data based on original data sourced from the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP) and World Bank's World Development Indicators.

    Our World in Data calculated absolute numbers based on original data on the number with access to safely managed drinking water and sanitation, and the total population numbers.

    – Number of people without access to safely managed drinking water = [population – number of people with access to safe drinking water]
    – Number of people without access to sanitation = [population – number of people with access to sanitation]
