name: patent_and_publication_rates_owid_based_on_world_bank_and_un
description: "Rates of patent application and scientific/technical publication were
    calculated by OurWorldinData based on a combination of World Bank, World Development
    Indicators (WDI) and United Nations Population Prospects estimates.\r\n\r\nRates
    were calculated per million people by dividing the absolute number of patent applications
    and scientific & technical journal articles (as published by the World Bank) by
    UN population estimates for any given year.\r\n\r\nThe World Bank indicators were
    based on \"patent applications, residents\" which measures the number of patent
    applications from residents of a given country; \"patent applications, nonresidents\"
    which measures the number of patent applications for any given country from individuals
    outside of that country. Patent applications are worldwide patent applications
    filed through the Patent Cooperation Treaty procedure or with a national patent
    office for exclusive rights for an invention--a product or process that provides
    a new way of doing something or offers a new technical solution to a problem.
    A patent provides protection for the invention to the owner of the patent for
    a limited period, generally 20 years.\r\n\r\n\"Scientific and technical journal
    articles\" which measures the number of scientific and engineering articles published
    in the following fields: physics, biology, chemistry, mathematics, clinical medicine,
    biomedical research, engineering and technology, and earth and space sciences.\r\n\r\nWorld
