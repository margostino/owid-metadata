description: "Estimates of the total number of deaths from the Chernobyl nuclear incidents
    remain contested: we have therefore included a series of published estimates to
    cover the range of considered values.\r\n\r\nWHO (2005a) refers to the number
    of deaths (up to 4000) estimated in the populations with highest exposure to radioactive
    fallout from the incident. WHO (2005b) add this to further estimates by the WHO
    [not included in its report] on the potential death toll in individuals beyond
    proximate areas.\r\n\r\nFairlie & Sumner (a) and (b) are represent their published
    lower and upper estimates, respectively.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\nIAEA, WHO (2005/06).
