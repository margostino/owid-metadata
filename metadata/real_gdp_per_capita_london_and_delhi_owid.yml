description: "The data presented here from 1990 onwards is from the World Bank. It
    is GDP per capita in 2011 international-$ as published here: http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.KD
    (accessed on April 16, 2017).\r\n\r\nData earlier than 1990 is backwards extended
    from the World Bank observation for 1990 based on the growth rates implied by
    Maddison data. The Maddison data is published here: http://www.ggdc.net/maddison/maddison-project/data.htm\r\n\r\nHere
    we have assumed GDP per capita for the UK and India is a proxy for London and
    Delhi, respectively."
