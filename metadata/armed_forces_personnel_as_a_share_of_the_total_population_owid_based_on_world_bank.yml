description: "This dataset has been constructed by Our World in Data based on two
    variables.\n\n– Armed forces personnel as published by the  International Institute
    for Strategic Studies - The Military Balance. This is made available via the World
    Bank World Development Indicators: http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators\n–
    The Our World in Data population series. Details on how this is constructed are
    available here: https://ourworldindata.org/population-sources\n\nArmed forces
    as a share of total population is then calculated by dividing total armed forces
    personnel by population and multiplying by 100. \n\nThe input and output files,
    and script used to calculate this data is available on GitHub here: https://github.com/owid/notebooks/tree/main/HannahRitchie/armed-forces\n\n-----\nArmed
    forces personnel are active duty military personnel, including paramilitary forces
    if the training, organization, equipment, and control suggest they may be used
    to support or replace regular military forces.\n\nLimitations and exceptions:
    Data excludes personnel not on active duty, therefore it underestimates the share
    of the labor force working for the defense establishment. The cooperation of governments
    of all countries listed in “The Military Balance” has been sought by IISS and,
    in many cases, received. However, some data in “The Military Balance” is estimated.\n\nStatistical
    concept and methodology: Military data on manpower represent quantitative assessment
    of the personnel strengths of the world's armed forces. The IISS collects the
    data from a wide variety of sources. The numbers are based on the most accurate
    data available to, or on the best estimate that can be made by the International
    Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) at the time of its annual publication.
    The current WDI indicator includes active armed forces and active paramilitary
    (but not reservists). Armed forces personnel comprise all servicemen and women
    on full-time duty, including conscripts and long-term assignments from the Reserves
    (“Reserve” describes formations and units not fully manned or operational in peacetime,
    but which can be mobilized by recalling reservists in an emergency). The indicator
    includes paramilitary forces. The source of the data (IISS) reports armed forces
    and paramilitary forces separately, however these figures are added for the purpose
    of computing this series. Home Guard units are counted as paramilitary."
