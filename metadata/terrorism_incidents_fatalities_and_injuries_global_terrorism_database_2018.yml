description: "The Global Terrorism Database definitions can be found at (https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/downloads/Codebook.pdf)
    and are as follows:\n\nA terrorist incident is included in GTD if it is the following:\n-
    The incident must be intentional – the result of a conscious calculation on the
    part of a perpetrator.\n- The incident must entail some level of violence or immediate
    threat of violence -including property violence, as well as violence against people.\n-
    The perpetrators of the incidents must be sub-national actors. The database does
    not include acts of state terrorism.\n\nIn addition, at least two of the following
    three criteria must be present for an incident to be included in the GTD:\n- Criterion
    1: The act must be aimed at attaining a political, economic, religious, or social
    goal. In terms of economic goals, the exclusive pursuit of profit does not satisfy
    this criterion. It must involve the pursuit of more profound, systemic economic
    change.\n- Criterion 2: There must be evidence of an intention to coerce, intimidate,
    or convey some other message to a larger audience (or audiences) than the immediate
    victims. It is the act taken as a totality that is considered, irrespective if
    every individual involved in carrying out the act was aware of this intention.
    As long as any of the planners or decision-makers behind the attack intended to
    coerce, intimidate or publicize, the intentionality criterion is met.\n- Criterion
    3: The action must be outside the context of legitimate warfare activities. That
    is, the act must be outside the parameters permitted by international humanitarian
    law (particularly the prohibition against deliberately targeting civilians or
    non-combatants).\n\nIs it defined as a suicide attack?\nThis variable is coded
    “Yes” in those cases where there is evidence that the perpetrator did not intend
    to escape from the attack alive. \n\nSuccessful vs. unsuccessful attacks:\n\"The
    GTD does include attacks that were attempted but ultimately unsuccessful. The
    circumstances vary depending on tactics (for details see the success variable,
    below). However, in general if a bomb is planted but fails to detonate; if an
    arsonist is intercepted by authorities before igniting a fire; or, if an assassin
    attempts and fails to kill his or her intended target, the attack is considered
    for inclusion in the GTD, but denoted as unsuccessful.\n\nSuccess of a terrorist
    strike is defined according to the tangible effects of the attack. Success is
    not judged in terms of the larger goals of the perpetrators. For example, a bomb
    that exploded in a building would be counted as a success even if it did not succeed
    in bringing the building down or inducing government repression. The definition
    of a successful attack depends on the type of attack. Essentially, the key question
    is whether or not the attack type took place. If a case has multiple attack types,
    it is successful if any of the attack types are successful, with the exception
    of assassinations, which are only successful if the intended target is killed.\"\n\nFatalities
    are defined as:\n\"The number of total confirmed fatalities for the incident.
    The number includes all victims and attackers who died as a direct result of the
    incident. Where there is evidence of fatalities, but a figure is not reported
    or it is too vague to be of use, this field remains blank. If information is missing
    regarding the number of victims killed in an attack, but perpetrator fatalities
    are known, this value will reflect only the number of perpetrators who died as
    a result of the incident. Likewise, if information on the number of perpetrators
    killed in an attack is missing, but victim fatalities are known, this field will
    only report the number of victims killed in the incident.\"\n\nInjuries are:\n\"the
    number of confirmed non-fatal injuries to both perpetrators and victims.\""
