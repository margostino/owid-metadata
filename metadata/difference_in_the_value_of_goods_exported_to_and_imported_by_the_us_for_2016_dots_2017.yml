name: difference_in_the_value_of_goods_exported_to_and_imported_by_the_us_for_2016_dots_2017
description: This data set consists of  differences between the value of goods that
    each country reports exporting to the US, and the value of goods that the US reports
    importing from the same countries. For example, for China, the figure in the chart
    corresponds to “Value of merchandise imports in US from China” minus “Value of
    merchandise exports from China to the US”. In all cases, values correspond to
    current US dollars. Asymmetries arise for different reasons, including the fact
    that exports are usually recorded in FOB prices, while imports are recorded in
    CIF prices.
