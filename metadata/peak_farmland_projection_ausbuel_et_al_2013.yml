description: |-
    This dataset is based on global arable land use projections from Ausubel et al. (2013), and combines two sources.

    Data from 1961-2014 is based on estimated global arable land use from the UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) database, available at: http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#home [accessed 12th August 2017].

    Data projections for 2015-2060 is based on model predications from the paper by Ausubel et al. (2013). This work projects that over the period 2010-2060, global arable land will decrease by 0.2 percent per year as a result of slowing population growth and agricultural productivity factors. We have taken this estimation from 2015 onwards.
