description: |-
    Data represents two series related to Chinese plastic waste:

    - the estimated quantity of domestic waste generation, imported recycled waste, and total plastic waste to manage, measured in tonnes per year (from 2010 to 2016).

    - the projected cumulative quantity of plastic waste displaced as a result of the Chinese plastic imported ban (over the period 2018-2030). This is shown under scenarios of a 100%, 75% or 50% Chinese ban on plastic waste imports.
