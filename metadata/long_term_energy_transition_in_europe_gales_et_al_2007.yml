description: "The authors note: “Muscle energy corresponds to the input of food by
    men and working animals; ﬁrewood to the actual consumption; wind and water have
    been estimated from the power of water and wind engines – sailing ships included
    – and the time, per year, these engines were in use.”\r\n\r\nFull citation: Ben
