name: share_of_single_parent_families_un_population_division_2018
description: "The variable for the share of single parent families is taken from the
    <a href=\"https://population.un.org/Household/index.html#/countries/840\">United
    Nations Database on Household Size and Composition (2018)</a>. \n\nThe UN database
    pulls from 4 different sources: \n1) Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS); \n2)
    the Demographic Yearbook (DYB) of the United Nations; \n3) IPUMS-International;\n4)
    Labor Force Surveys (LFS) of the European Union, Eurostat. \n\nWhere a country
    time series was composed of multiple sources, we favoured the source covering
    the most years. In cases where there was a tie between sources, we favoured the
    DYB, then IPUMS, DHS, and lastly LFS estimates. The DYB covered the largest number
    of countries and the LFS the least.  \n\nWhere multiple country-year observations
    came from the same source, we favoured the observation with the reference date
    occurring later in the year. This is true for Senegal in 2013 and Tanzania in
    2004.\n\nThe source for each observation can be found in the metadata spreadsheet
    <a href=\"https://owid.cloud/app/uploads/2020/01/un-single-parent-final-metadata-stan.csv\">here</a>.
