description: "Boeker et al. (2017) project global antibiotic use under business-as-usual
    antibiotic concentrations and projected meat consumption.\r\n\r\nThe authors also
    project a number of potential reduction scenarios:\r\n- a global limit of 50 milligrams
    of antibiotic use per kilogram of meat production.\r\n- a limit of 50 milligrams
    of antibiotic use per kilogram of meat production for OECD countries & China.\r\n-
    global per capita meat consumption of 40 grams per day (the equivalent of an average
    burger patty)\r\n- global per capita meat consumption of 165 grams per day (the
    projected EU average in 2030)\r\n\r\nProjected global antibiotic use for livestock
    are shown for each of these potential reduction scenarios."
