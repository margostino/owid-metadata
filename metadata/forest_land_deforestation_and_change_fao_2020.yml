    Raw data for forest area, deforestation, afforestation and expansion is sourced from the UN FAO Forest Resources Assessment.

    Our World in Data have calculated several metrics based on this raw data including:
    – Net change in forest area (afforestation minus deforestation)
    – Net conversion rate (net change as a percentage of forest area)
    – Each country's share of global forest area, deforestation, afforestation, and net change in forests
    – Each country's share of regional forest area, deforestation, afforestation, and net change in forests

    The UN FAO publish forest area and forest change data as the annual average on 10- or 5-year timescales. Therefore the following year allocation applies:
    – 1990: the annual average over the period from 1990 to 2000.
    – 2000: the annual average over the period from 2000 to 2010.
    – 2010: the annual average over the period from 2010 to 2015.
    – 2015: the annual average over the period from 2015 to 2020.

    Data on forest cover by country pre-1990 is sourced from a variety sources which are documented here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nYpao4e8Ai-P86jIUZ3r7X6-5MjZ7ZbG7TJQSO729Bg/edit?usp=sharing
