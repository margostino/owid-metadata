description: "Primary energy consumption data was compiled by Our World in Data based
    on two key data sources: \n1. BP Statistical Review of World Energy: https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy.html\n2.
    Shift Energy Data Portal: https://www.theshiftdataportal.org/energy\n\nBP provides
    the longest and most up-to-date time-series of primary energy. However, it does
    provide data for all countries. We have therefore supplemented this dataset with
    energy data from the Shift Energy Data Portal. Where BP provides data for a given
    country, this data is adopted; for countries where this data is missing, we rely
    on Shift Energy figures.\n\nThe Shift Project draws on two sources: \n– Etemad
    & Luciani for the period 1900-1980 Bouda Etemad and Jean Luciani, World Energy
    Production 1900 – 1985, ISBN 2-600-56007-6, Data digitalized and published with
    agreement of B. Etemad\n– US EIA Historical Statistics for 1980-2016. U.S. Energy
    Information Administration\n\nTo convert from total primary energy to per capita
    figures we use population figures from the UN World Population Prospects: https://population.un.org/wpp/.\n\nTo
    calculate energy per unit of GDP, we use total real GDP figures from the Maddison
    Project Database (2018): http://www.ggdc.net/maddison/oriindex.htm. This is measured
    in 2011$ which are PPP-adjusted.\n\n"
