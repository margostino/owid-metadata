description: "Authors' note on the data sources used: \"Urban/rural fractions for
    all countries were derived from the UN after ad 1950 (UN, 2008b). Earlier historical
    urbanization estimates for Europe were derived from De Vries (1984), Bairoch et
    al. (1988), Chandler (1987), for Canada after ad 1890 from Urquhart and Buckley
    (1965), for China from Rozman (1973) and Maddison (1995), for Colombia from Etter
    et al. (2006), USA from Dodd (1993), all other countries were estimated similar
    to De Vries (1984), which data yielded roughly a factor 10 lower in ad 1700 compared
    with the 1950 value of the UN.\"\n\nFull citation: \nKlein Goldewijk, K. , A.
