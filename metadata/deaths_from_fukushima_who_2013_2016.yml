description: "Estimates of the total number of deaths from the Fukushima nuclear incident.\n\nThere
    were no direct deaths from the Fukushima Daiichi disaster. The official death
    toll was 573 people, all of which were premature deaths from evacuation and displacement
    of populations in the surrounding area: \n\nIn 2018, the Japanese government reported
    that one worker has since died from lung cancer as a result of exposure from the
    event: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-45423575\n\nEstimates for Fukushima
    have been derived from the WHO (2013; 2016), and official death toll from the
    Government of Japan.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) Report published five
    years on, suggests very low risk of increased cancer deaths in Japan. In a review
    of the response and long-term health impacts of Fukushima, published by Michael
    Reich and Aya Goto in The Lancet (2015), the authors note that: “no one has died
    from radiation exposure, and the UN Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic
    Radiation report in 2013 stated that substantial changes in future cancer statistics
    attributed to radiation exposure are not expected to be observed\".\n\nSources:\n\nWorld
