description: The data presented in the IRENA REsource database comes from a variety
    of sources. Most of the data are official statistics submitted by countries to
    IRENA using the IRENA renewable energy statistics questionnaire during its annual
    data collection cycle or taken from official publications. Where official statistics
    are unavailable, the statistics are supplemented with IRENA estimates or third
    party data such as that from industry associations.
