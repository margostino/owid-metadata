description: "There are three main types of nails: hand forged, machine cut, and wire.
    Blacksmiths produced hand forged nails until about 1820. Cut nails have been produced
    using a machine which cuts nails from sheets of iron or steel - technology patents
    for this machinery emerging in the late 18th century. Wire nails became more widely
    produced in the late 19th century with individual nails cut from a coil of drawn
    wire, one end sharpened at the tip, and the head of the nail added to the other
    (Sichel (2017)). \r\n\r\nReal prices are calculated using Sichel’s (2017) consumer
    price index (CPI) dating back to 1695 constructed from the UK retail price index
    (RPI) from 1695-1784, and US CPI from 1784-2011. 2010 is used as the base year,
    so all prices adjusted for inflation are in terms of 2010 dollars. To calculate
    real price of nails in cents/lb, we use the following procedure:\r\n\r\nReal price
    of nails (cents/lb) = Nominal price of nails (cents/lb) divided by (CPI /100)
    \r\n\r\nHowever, the real price of nails measured in units of cents per pound
    can obscure quality differences. To adjust for differences in quality, Sichel
    (2017) standardizes nail sizes, converting all nails to be as close as possible
    to a 2”, size 6d nail, to construct real prices in cents per nail. The counts
    of nails per pound used for each year can be found in Table 3 of Sichel’s (2017)
    working paper.\r\n\r\nIn calculating the real price of nails (cents/nail), we
    first convert units from cents per pound to cents per nail, and then convert from
    nominal to real prices. \r\n\r\nNominal price of nails (cents/nail) = Nominal
    price of nail (cents/lb) x 1/[count of nails per pound]\r\n\r\nReal price of nails
    (cents/nail) = Nominal price of nails (cents/nail) divided by (CPI/100)\r\n\r\nThe
    nominal price series for nails, from which the real series have been constructed,
    are comprised of multiple data sources. \r\n\r\nFrom 1695 to 1792, prices are
    from Beveridge (1939) in the United Kingdom. Where data is not reported for selected
    years, the values for these years are interpolated. Prices have been converted
    from shillings to cents. \r\n\r\nFor the period 1784 to 1813 prices are sourced
    from Cole (1938) although the type of nails have not been specified and are thus
    assumed to be mixed (forged and cut) nails. \r\n\r\nFrom 1814 to 1890 data covers
    machine-cut nail prices. Between 1814 and 1828, prices are taken from Cole (1938).
    Quotes for later years are from various sources with the data reproduced in ‘Historical
    Statistics of the United States’. \r\n\r\nThe period covering 1890 up until 2011
    refers to wire nails. This section of the data series includes data from the Bureau
    of Labor Statistics. \r\nFor greater detail in the construction of this dataset,
