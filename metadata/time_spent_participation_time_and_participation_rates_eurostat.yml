name: time_spent_participation_time_and_participation_rates_eurostat
description: "This Eurostat data set measures the time spent, participation time,
    and participation rate in 55 activities. \n\nFor the purposes of illustrating
    how time use has changed over time, we have aggregated the 55 activities under
    six main headings provided in the original Eurostat source. The six headings are
    (1) Personal care; (2) Employment, related activities, and travel; (3) Study;
    (4) Household and family care; (5) Leisure, social, and associative life; and
    (6) Travel and unspecified time use. The data has been normalised to 1440 minutes
    per day. \n\nThe survey population includes private participants only - individuals
    living in institutions (nursing homes, homes for the elderly, childrenâ€™s homes,
    rehabilitation centres and penitentiary) are excluded. For further information
    on the time use surveys see: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/metadata/en/tus_esms.htm"
