description: |-
    This dataset provides aggregated data on fish biomass, fishing pressure and catch by region and taxa, based on the results of the RAM Legacy Stock Assessment Database: https://www.ramlegacy.org/

    This aggregated data was provided by Michael Melnychuk, researcher on the RAM Legacy Database.

    These results were published in PNAS here:
    Hilborn, R., Amoroso, R. O., Anderson, C. M., Baum, J. K., Branch, T. A., Costello, C., ... & Ye, Y. (2020). Effective fisheries management instrumental in improving fish stock status. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 117(4), 2218-2224. Available at: https://www.pnas.org/content/117/4/2218

    Definitions are as follows:
    – 'Biomass' is a measure of biomass of fish divided by the biomass of fish at the maximum sustainable yield (B / Bmsy)
    – 'Fishing pressure' is a measure of fishing pressure divided by the pressure at the maximum sustainable yield (U / Umsy)
    – 'Catch' is a measure of the annual catch divided by the mean catch across the stock's time series
