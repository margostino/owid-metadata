description: "Codebook notes:\n\" The National Elections across Democracy and Autocracy
    (NELDA) dataset provides detailed information on all election events from 1945-2012.
    To be included, elections must be for a national executive figure, such as a president,
    or for a national legislative body, such as a parliament, legislature, constituent
    assembly, or other directly elected representative bodies. In order for an election
    to be included, voters must directly elect the person or persons appearing on
    the ballot to the national post in question.\n\nElections may or may not be competitive,
    and may have any number of other ostensible flaws. In fact, the inclusion of flawed
    elections is a feature of the NELDA dataset. \"\n\nThe unit of observation is
    the NELDA dataset is the election round. The ElectionID variable has been used
    to collapse multi-round elections into one observation for OWIDâ€™s purposes. In
    three election events, Equatorial Guinea's 1993 legislative/parliamentary election,
    Equatorial Guinea's 1996 presidential/other direct executive election, and Zimbabwe's
    2005 legislative/parliamentary election, these election events were coded as unobserved
    by Western monitors, yet criticized with allegations of significant vote-fraud.
    For our purposes, these three election events have been re-coded as unobserved
    and not criticized as no Western monitors were in the country at the time to monitor
    the election.\n\nThe percent of observed and criticized elections was calculated
    as:\n\n% observed and criticized elections = (no.of criticized elections/ total
    no. of elections) * 100\n\nThe percent of observed and not criticized elections
    was calculated as:\n\n% observed and not criticized elections = [(no. of observed
    elections - no. of criticized elections)/total number of elections] * 100\n\nMicrostates,
    defined as those countries with less than 500,000 citizens at the time of election,
    have been excluded. Five independent states that did not hold any direct elections
    between 1945-2012 - China, Eritrea, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates
    - have also been excluded. "
