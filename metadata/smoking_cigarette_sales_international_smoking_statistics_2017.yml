description: "Total cigarettes include both manufactured and hand-rolled cigarettes.
    For Latvia, total cigarettes comprise of manufactured cigarettes and Papyrosi
    cigarettes. \n\nIn some countries the original data reports 0 for a specific year,
    with otherwise large reported values for the years before and after. In these
    cases we treat 0 as a mistake and report missing data for that year.\n\nThe 'number
    of cigarettes smoked per person per day' for both males and females has been averaged
    across all years in which multiple estimates were provided in the ISS dataset
    for the United States, to arrive at one estimate for each year.\n\nThe time series
    for Germany includes West Germany cigarette sales for the 1948-1989 period ."
