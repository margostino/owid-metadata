name: renewables_patents_irena_2016
description: "Data reports the annual number of new patents filed under the category
    of each renewable technology.\r\nAnnual number of patents by technology for the
    years 2014-2016 was calculated by OWID based on IRENA's cumulative number of patents
    for each technology in these years (i.e. annual number in 2014 = cumulative total
    in 2015 minus cumulative total in 2014).\r\n\r\nNote that figures for 2014-16
    may be subject to a time lag; processing times of patent applications vary and
    some patents submitted over this period may not yet be recorded in statistics.
    These figures will be updated with time if additional patent applications are
    recorded.\r\n\r\n"
