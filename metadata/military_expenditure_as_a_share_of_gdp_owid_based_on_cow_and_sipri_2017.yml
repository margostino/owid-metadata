description: "The National Material Capabilities dataset, from the Correlates of War
    (COW) Project, contains long-run estimates of the military power of countries.\n\nThe
    COW data series on military expenditure ends in 2012 and it is measured in current
    currency units; specifically British Pounds up to the year 1914, and US Dollars
    thereafter. This reflects the fact that the COW data was originally intended for
    cross-country comparisons at specific points in time, rather than for tracking
    changes in military expenditure over the long-run.\n\nConsidering this, at Our
    World in Data we have produced a new dataset, based on the COW data, which does
    allow for comparisons both across countries and time. Here is a description of
    what we have done. \n<ol>\n\t<li>We first took the COW dataset and used historical
    exchange rates from the Bank of England to unify the entire series into a single
    currency (nominal British Pounds).</li>\n\t<li>Then we converted this series into
    shares of GDP. For this we used historical cross-country estimates of nominal
    GDP, also available in British Pounds from the CEPII research centre.</li>\n\t<li>Finally,
    we extended the series forward up until 2016 by appending data from SIPRI, as
    published in the World Bank's World Development Indicators <a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/MS.MIL.XPND.GD.ZS?page\"
    rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</li></ol>\nPlease note that we use
    exchange rates from the Bank of England because the original exchange rates used
    to produce the COW estimates are not available. While we are aware that this introduces
    noise to the series, we believe that this does not affect trends or levels in
    any systematic way. It simply adds to the margin of error that historical estimates
    already had.\n\nAlso note that the entity 'World' shows values from SIPRI for
    the period 1960-2016. "
