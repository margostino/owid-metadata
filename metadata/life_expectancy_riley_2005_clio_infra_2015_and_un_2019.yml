description: "Data was compiled by Our World in Data based on estimates by James C.
    Riley, Clio Infra, and the United Nations Population Division.\n\nFor regional-
    and global-level data pre-1950, we use data from a study by Riley, which draws
    from over 700 sources to estimate life expectancy at birth from 1800 to 2001.\n\nRiley
    estimated life expectancy before 1800, which he calls \"the pre-health transition
    period\". \"Health transitions began in different countries in different periods,
    as early as the 1770s in Denmark and as late as the 1970s in some countries of
    sub-Saharan Africa\". As such, for the sake of consistency, we have assigned the
    period before the health transition to the year 1770. \"The life expectancy values
    employed are averages of estimates for the period before the beginning of the
    transitions for countries within that region. ... This period has presumably the
    weakest basis, the largest margin of error, and the simplest method of deriving
    an estimate.\"\n\nFor country-level data pre-1950, we use Clio Infra's dataset,
    compiled by Zijdeman and Ribeira da Silva (2015).\n\nFor country-, regional- and
    global-level data post-1950, we use data published by the United Nations Population
    Division, since they are updated every year. This is possible because Riley writes
    that \"for 1950-2001, I have drawn life expectancy estimates chiefly from various
    sources provided by the United Nations, the World Bankâ€™s World Development Indicators,
    and the Human Mortality Database\". \n\nFor the Americas from 1950-2015, we took
    the population-weighted average of Northern America and Latin America and the
    Caribbean, using UN Population Division estimates of population size."
