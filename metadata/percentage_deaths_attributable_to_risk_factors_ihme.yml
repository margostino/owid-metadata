name: percentage_deaths_attributable_to_risk_factors_ihme
description: Data represents the share of deaths which can be attributed to the prevalence
    of risk factors, including smoking, diet & nutrition, obesity, alcohol and drug
    consumption, unsafe sex, poor sanitation, water access, air pollution and environmental
    exposures. The remaining share is therefore the share of deaths which would occur
    in the absence of any linked risk factors.
