description: "Estimates by Eriksen et al. (2014) on the number of plastic particles
    of surface ocean debris floating at sea, differentiated by ocean basin and particle
    size.\n\nParticle size categories range from small microplastics to macroplastics.
    \n\nEstimates are based on results from 24 expeditions (over the period 2007–2013)
    across all five sub-tropical gyres, costal Australia, Bay of Bengal and the Mediterranean
    Sea conducting surface net tows (N = 680) and visual survey transects of large
    plastic debris (N = 891). These field-based results were combined with oceanographic
    modelling of floating debris dispersal and wind-driven vertical mixing to derive
    total oceanic figures."
