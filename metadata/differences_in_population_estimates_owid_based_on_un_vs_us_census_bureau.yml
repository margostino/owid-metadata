description: "This dataset was calculated by OWID based on population estimates from
    the UN Population Division (2017) and US Census Bureau.\r\n\r\nAbsolute differences
    measure the absolute difference in regional and global population estimates from
    the UN Population Division and US Census Bureau. Figures were calculated as the
    annual total population estimate from the UN Population Division (2017) minus
    population estimates from the US Census Bureau.\r\n\r\nRelative differences measure
    this difference in estimates as a percentage of UN figures (i.e. (UN population
    - US Census Bureau population) / UN population).\r\n\r\nNegative figures therefore
    represent lower UN estimates vs. US Census Bureau estimates, and vice versa (positive
    values indicate higher UN estimates).\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\nUnited Nations,
