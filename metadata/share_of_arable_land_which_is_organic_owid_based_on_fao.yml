description: "Share of arable land which is organic is derived by Our World in Data
    based on UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Statistics on total arable
    land area, and organic arable land area. The share is calculated as: total arable
    area (ha) / organic arable land area (ha).\n\nOrganic arable land area is the
    sum of the area certified as organic by official standards, and land area in the
    conversion process to organic (which is assumed by the FAO as a two-year period
    prior to certification). "
