name: five_year_cancer_survival_rates_allemani_et_al
description: |-
    Data is based on the percentage of those diagnosed with cancer who survive at least five years after the date of diagnosis. This is measured across the top 10 common malignancies in adults (aged 15-99), and leukaemia in children (aged 0-14). This share is age-standardized assuming a constant age distribution of the population to compare between countries and with time.

    The dates presented here are given as single-year but represent average net survival rates over a multi-year diagnosis period. Data here labelled '1999' represents average survival rates over the period 1995-1999; '2004' for 2000-2004; '2009' for 2005-2009.
