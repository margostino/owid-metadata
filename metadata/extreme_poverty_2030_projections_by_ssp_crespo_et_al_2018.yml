description: "Data on extreme poverty projections by country and region are sourced
    from the Nature publication by Crespo-Cuaresma et al. (2018). This data is also
    presented visually at the World Poverty Clock: http://worldpoverty.io/index.html\n\nExtreme
    poverty is defined by the international poverty line, set at a threshold of $1.90
    per person per day, which is adjusted for inflation (by normalising to 2011 dollars),
    and corrected for cross-country price differences (PPP).\n\nThe UN's Sustainable
    Development Goal (SDG) Target 1.1 is to end extreme poverty by 2030. 'Ending extreme
    poverty' is assumed when a country reaches an extreme poverty level below 3% of
    the total population.\n\nScenarios of future extreme poverty rates were assessed
    and modelled by Crespo-Cuaresma et al. (2018) using a combination of the IMF World
    Economic Outlook, and multiple Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP). \n\nThe SSPs
    are defined broadly as follows:\n- SSP1: low challenges for both climate change
    adaptation and mitigation resulting from income growth which does not rely heavily
    on natural resources and technological change, coupled with low fertility rate
    and high educational attainment.\n\n- SSP2: the benchmark scenario and assumes
    the continuation of current global socioeconomic trends at the global level. \n\n-
    SSP3: low economic growth coupled with low educational attainment levels and high
    population growth at the global level are the main elements of the narrative,
    which is characterized by high mitigation and adaptation challenges.\n\n- SSP4:
    presents a narrative of worldwide polarization, with high income countries exhibiting
    relatively high growth rates of income, while developing economies present low
    levels of education, high fertility and economic stagnation.\n\n- SSP5: presents
    a scenario with high economic growth (and therefore low adaptation challenges)
    coupled with high demand for fossil energy from developing economies, but with
    high global CO2 emissions.\n\nSSP2 is defined as the baseline 'business-as-usual'
    scenario. \n\nThe categories of 'extremely fragile', 'fragile' and 'non-fragile'
    have been added for reference based on the OECD (2018) States of Fragility framework.
    This framework measures the fragility of countries based on multiple political
    and socioeconomic indicators. More information on this fragility measure can be
    found at the OECD (2018) report.\n\nReference: OECD (2018), States of Fragility.
