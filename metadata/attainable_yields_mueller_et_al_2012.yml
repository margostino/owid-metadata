description: |-
    Attainable yields are estimates of feasible crop yields calculated from high-yielding areas of similar climate. They are more conservative than biophysical ‘potential yields’, but should be achievable using current technologies and management (e.g. fertilizers and irrigation). Attainable yields are based on assessments for the year 2000. Attainable yield pre-2000 may be lower; and post-2000 may be higher than these values.

    Yield gaps have been calculated by Our World in Data as the difference between actual observed yields (as reported by the UN FAO: http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/) and attainable yields, as reported by Mueller et al. (2012).
