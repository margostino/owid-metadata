    Life evaluation was measured by the individual answers to the Cantril ladder question: “Please imagine a ladder, with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?”

    The value shown in a given year is the average of that year and the previous and following year. For example, the value given for 2020 is an average of the values for 2019-2021.

    This dataset should be next updated by the source in April 2023. We will update it on Our World in Data soon after the new version is published. At the link above you can directly access the source page and see the latest available data.
