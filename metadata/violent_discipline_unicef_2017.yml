description: "– The source notes that in some instances observations differ from the
    standard definition or refer to only part of a country. \r\n\r\n– The dates associated
    to each observation correspond to the end of the survey used as underlying source
    \r\n\r\n– Most estimates come from the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS).
    The MICS include a standard set of questions covering different disciplinary methods.
    It does allow survey respondents to report both violent and nonviolent forms of
    discipline.\r\n\r\n–The source notes that estimates reported in UNICEF publications
    and in MICS country reports prior to 2010 were calculated using household weights
    that did not take into account the last-stage selection of children for the administration
    of the child discipline module in MICS surveys. (A random selection of one child
    aged 2–14 is undertaken for the administration of the child discipline module.)
    In January 2010, it was decided that more accurate estimates are produced by using
    a household weight that takes the last-stage selection into account. MICS3 data
    were recalculated using this approach. All estimates produced after 2010 use the
    revised estimates.\r\n\r\n– When it was first implemented in MICS3, the child
    discipline module was administered only to mothers/primary caregivers, who were
    asked whether any of the disciplinary methods covered in the module had been used
    by any member of the household during the month preceding the interview. Beginning
    with MICS4, the methodology was changed: Any adult household member, not just
    the mother or primary caregiver, can now respond to the questions on child discipline."
