description: "The Women's Economic Opportunity (WEO) Index measures five categories
    to determine whether the environment for both women employees and women entrepreneurs
    is favourable. Five category scores are calculated from the unweighted mean of
    underlying indicators and scaled 0-100, where 100=most favourable. These categories
    are: Labor policy and practice (comprising two sub-categories: Labor policy and
    labor practice); Access to Finance; Education and training; Women's legal and
    social status; and the General business environment. Each category or sub-category
    features either four or five underlying indicators.\n\nThe overall score (from
    0-100) is calculated from a simple average of the unweighted category and indicator
    variables. That is, every indicator contributes equally to their parent category
    and every category contributes equally to the overall score.\n\nEIU note: The
    criteria used in this study were chosen in close consultation between the Economist
    Intelligence Unit and panels of experts, mostly in 2009 and 2010. The indicator
    list was reviewed and revised at an experts meeting held at the offices of UN
    Women in July 2011.\n\nWorld Bank classifications include entities: High income
    (OECD), High income, High income (non-OECD), Upper-middle income, Lower-middle
    income, Low income, Europe & Central Asia, Latin America & the Caribbean, East
    Asia & Pacific, Middle East & North Africa, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa.
    \n\nUN classifications include entities: Europe, Americas, Oceania, Asia, and
    Africa."
