    Gapminder definition of life expectancy: The average number of years a newborn child would live if current mortality patterns were to stay the same. Interpolated values of life expectancy have been used.

    The UN Population Division defines life expectancy at birth as: The average number of years of life expected by a hypothetical cohort of individuals who would be subject during all their lives to the mortality rates of a given period. Interpolated values have been used.


    Gapminder data is used up until 1949. UN Population Division (2017 Revision) data is used from 1950 to today.
