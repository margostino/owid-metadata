description: "\n<strong>Definition and sources by country</strong></br>\nFor OECD
    countries, figures correspond to mean age at first marriage from the OECD Family
    Database. For other countries, figures correspond to Singulate Mean Age at Marriage
    from the UN World Marriage Data 2019.  \n\nThe Singulate Mean Age at Marriage
    (SMAM) is an indirect estimate of the average age at first marriage, and is calculated
    from survey data on marital status by age.\n\nTo calculate the SMAM, the UN World
    Marriage Database combines multiple sources for each country, including both census
    and survey estimates. For comparability, we have chosen to report only one source
    per country, favouring the source that provides the longest time series for each
    country. \n\nThe following is a list of sources underlying our UN estimates, from
    most to least coverage: UNSD, DHS_STATcompiler, National Statistics, MICS, the
    US Census Bureau, INED, Eurostat, and IPUMS. \n\nA full breakdown of the source
    used for each observation in this dataset can be found <a href=\"https://owid.cloud/app/uploads/2020/01/oecd-un-mix-final-metadata-stand.csv\">here</a>.\n\n<strong>Further
    notes on Singulate Mean Age at Marriage</strong></br>\nThe Singulate Mean Age
    at Marriage is derived from the proportion of single persons of each sex in successive
    age groups. The main assumption involved in this computation is that change in
    the proportion single from age x to x+1 is a measure of the proportion of a birth
    cohort who married at age x. The methodology enables computation of mean age at
    marriage of persons (male or female) aged 15 years and above before they attain
    the age of 50. In other words, it provides an estimate of the average number of
    years lived in the never married status by those who marry before the age of 50.\n\n<strong>OECD
    country series notes</strong></br>\n- Estimates for Australia, New Zealand and
    the United States provide the median, rather than mean age at first marriage\n-
    For Mexico, data refer to all marriages and not only first marriage\n- For Canada,
    data include the legal union of two persons of the same sex in some provinces
    and territories from 2003 onwards, and in all of Canada from 2005 onwards.\n-
    For New Zealand data include civil unions. From 2007 onwards, data include those
    who transferred their civil union to a marriage. \n- From 2014 onwards, data for
    the United Kingdom include marriages between same-sex partners."
