description: "Data is calculated by OurWorldinData as the net change in population
    from one year to the next e.g. figures for 1900 represent the net change in population
    between 1900 and 1901.\r\n\r\nThese calculations are based on the 'OurWorldinData'-series
    derived from various sources. The data for the period before 1900 are taken from
    the History Database of the Global Environment (HYDE). The History Database of
    the Global Environment (HYDE) collected the data by earlier publications. The
    data for the World Population between 1900 and 1940 is taken from the UN publication
    'The World at Six Billion'. The annual data for the World Population between 1950
    and 2015 is taken from the United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs,
    Population Division (2017). World Population Prospects: The 2017 Revision, DVD
    Edition. Available at: https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/\r\n\r\nData
    from 2016 onwards is based on the above UN source's 'medium variant' projection
    to the year 2100.\r\n\r\nThe HYDE Database is available at: \thttp://themasites.pbl.nl/tridion/en/themasites/hyde/basicdrivingfactors/population/index-2.html\r\n\r\nThe
    full 'OurWorldinData' series is available to download at: https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/WorldPopulationAnnual12000years_interpolated_HYDEandUNto2015.csv"
