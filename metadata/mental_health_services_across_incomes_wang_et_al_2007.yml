description: "Data is available only for a small number of countries, and based on
    household surveys over the period 2001-2004.\n\n'Share receiving any treatment
    for mental health' refers to the percentage of total respondents (with or without
    mental health burden) who received any form of treatment in the last 12 months.\n\nIn
    differentiating the share of people with particular severities of mental illness
    receiving treatment, the authors define the following categories:\n- 'Severe'
    = \"bipolar I disorder or substance dependence with a physiological dependence
    syndrome, making a suicide attempt in conjunction with any other disorder, reporting
    severe role impairment due to a mental disorder in at least two areas of functioning
    measured by disorder-specific Sheehan Disability Scales (SDS),12 or having overall
    functional impairment from any disorder consistent with a Global Assessment of
    Functioning (GAF)13 score of 50 or less.\"\n\n- 'Moderate' = \"substance dependence
    without a physiological dependence syndrome or at least moderate interference
    in any SDS domain\"\n\n- 'Mild' = all other disorders not noted above.\n\nMental
    health services were classified into the following sectors: \n- mental health
    specialty (psychiatrist, psychologist, other mental health professional in any
    setting, social worker or counsellor in a mental health specialty setting, use
    of a mental health hotline); \n- general medical (primary care doctor, other general
    medical doctor, nurse, any other health professional not previously mentioned);
    \n- human services (religious or spiritual advisor, social worker, or counsellor
    in any setting other than a specialty mental health setting);\n- complementary
    and alternative medicine (any other type of healer such as chiropractors, participation
    in an internet support group, participation in a self-help group)."
