description: "Per capita CO2 emissions have been calculated based on the combination
    of global emissions data from CDIAC (described below), and UN Population Prospects
    data.\r\n\r\nPopulation data was derived from: The History Database of the Global
    Environment (HYDE) collected the data by earlier publications. For the 'OurWorldInData'-series
    we used various sources: The data for the period before 1900 are taken from the
    History Database of the Global Environment (HYDE). The data for the World Population
    between 1900 and 1940 is taken from the UN puplication 'The World at Six Billion'.
    The annual data for the World Population between 1950 and 2015 is taken from the
    UN's World Population Prospects: The 2015 Revision. It is the series 'Total Population
    - Both Sexes' online available at: https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/.\r\n\r\nEmissions
    data have been sourced from the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Centre (CDIAC)
    database. Emissions data have been converted from units of carbon to carbon dioxide
    (CO2) using a conversion factor of 3.67.\r\n\r\nCDIAC denote a \"statistical difference\"
    component which has been included in this data. This statistical difference represents
    the difference between estimated global CO2 emissions and the sum of national
    totals. Estimates of CO2 emissions show that the global total of emissions is
    not equal to the sum of emissions from all countries. This is introduced in several
    cases: emissions within international territories, which are included in global
    totals but not attributed to individual countries; inconsistent national reporting
    where global import and export data is imbalanced; and differing treatment of
    non-fuel uses of hydrocarbons.\r\n\r\nFull methodology on global, regional, national
    and statistical difference estimations can be found in Le Quere et al. (2016):
