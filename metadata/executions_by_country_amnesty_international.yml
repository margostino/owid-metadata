description: "\tAmnesty Interntional note: \r\n\"Amnesty\r\nInternational reports
    only on executions, death sentences and other aspects of the use of\r\nthe death
    penalty, such as commutations and exonerations, where there is reasonable\r\nconfirmation.\r\nIn
    many countries governments do not publish information on their use of the\r\ndeath
    penalty. In Belarus, China and Viet Nam, data on the use of the death penalty
    is\r\nclassified as a state secret. During 2016 little or no information was available
    on some\r\ncountries – in particular Laos, North Korea (the Democratic People’s
    Republic of Korea),\r\nSyria and Yemen – due to restrictive state practice and/or
    armed conflict.\r\nTherefore, with only a few exceptions, Amnesty International’s
    figures on the use of the death\r\npenalty are minimum figures.\r\nThe true figures
    are likely to be higher. Where the organization\r\nobtains fuller information
    on a specific country in a given year this is noted in Amnesty International's
    report.\r\nIn 2009 Amnesty International stopped publishing its estimated figures
    on the use of the\r\ndeath penalty in China. Amnesty International always made
    clear that the figures it was able\r\nto publish on China were significantly lower
    than the reality, because of the restrictions on\r\naccess to information. Amnesty
    International’s decision to stop publishing data reflected\r\nconcerns about how
    the Chinese authorities misrepresented Amnesty International’s\r\nnumbers. Since
    2009 the organization challenged China to publish information on the use of\r\nthe
    death penalty. China has yet to publish any figures on the death penalty. However,\r\navailable
    information indicates that thousands of people are executed and sentenced to death\r\nin
    China each year.\" \r\n\r\n"
