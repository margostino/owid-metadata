name: united_nations_peacekeeping
description: |-
    All data is taken directly from the United Nations, with the exception for the historical size of the peacekeeping force (1947-1991), which is instead taken from the Global Policy Forum. Available at: https://www.globalpolicy.org/security-council/peacekeeping/peacekeeping-data.html

    The data for the size and breakdown of the peacekeeping force from the United Nations is taken as the value reported in the December report at the end of the year (with the exception for 1998, which is taken in November).

    For example, summaries from 2010 onwards are given here: https://peacekeeping.un.org/sites/default/files/00-front_page_msr_december_2021.pdf. We have taken figures from December in that report as the figures for a given year.
