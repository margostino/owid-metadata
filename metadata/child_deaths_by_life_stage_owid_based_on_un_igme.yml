name: child_deaths_by_life_stage_owid_based_on_un_igme
description: "Data represents the total number of deaths of children (under 5 years
    old) by life stage. \n\nThis is split into three categories: \n- the first 28
    days of life; \n- 29 days to 1 year; \n- 1-4 years.\n\nThis was calculated by
    Our World in Data based on data on neonatal, infant and under-5 deaths published
    by the World Bank (based on the UN IGME).\n\n- The first 28 days of life are equally
    to neonatal deaths;\n- 29 days to 1 year are calculated as infant minus neonatal
    deaths;\n- 1-4 years calculated as under-5s minus infant deaths."
