description: "The metric of extreme single-day precipitation events measures the share
    of land area which experienced over a threshold percentage of precipitation in
    an extreme single-day burst. \n\nThe metric of an unusually high precipitation
    year is measured on the basis of the standardized precipitation index (SPI). which
    compares actual yearly precipitation totals with the range of precipitation totals
    that one would typically expect at a specific location, based on historical data.
    If a location experiences less precipitation than normal during a particular period,
    it will receive a negative SPI score, while a period with more precipitation than
    normal will receive a positive score. The more precipitation (compared with normal),
    the higher the SPI score. The SPI is a useful way to look at precipitation totals
    because it allows comparison of different locations and different seasons on a
    standard scale. \n\nThe data on unusually high precipitation shows the share of
    land area in the US which experienced an SPI value of 2.0 or above (well above
    normal) in a given year.\n\nNine-year smoothed average trends for these metrics
    are also available."
