    Data is based on the UN's final evaluation of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and sourced from its final report (http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/2015_MDG_Report/pdf/MDG%202015%20rev%20(July%201).pdf) and Statistical Database (http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mdg/Resources/Static/Products/Progress2015/StatAnnex.pdf).

    The specific Targets with data here are:
    MDG1.A: halve share of people living in extreme poverty (defined as living on less than $1.25 per day - the historical poverty line).

    MDG1.B: achieve full and productive employment, as well as decent work for all, including young people and women.

    MDG1.C: halve the proportion of individuals suffering from hunger.

    MDG2: ensure that children universally – including both boys and girls – will be able to complete a full course of primary education by 2015.

    MDG3.A: eliminate gender disparity in primary and secondary education, preferably by 2005, and in all levels of education no later than 2015.

    MDG4.A: reduce the under-five mortality rate by two-thirds in the period between 1990 and 2015.

    MDG5.A: reduce the maternal mortality ratio by 75 percent.

    MDG5.B: achieve universal access to reproductive health.
