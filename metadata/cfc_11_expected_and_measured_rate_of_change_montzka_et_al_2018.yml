name: cfc_11_expected_and_measured_rate_of_change_montzka_et_al_2018
description: |-
    Data denotes the measured annual change in concentrations of trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11) gas as the global average, collected via air collection and analysis automated onsite instrumentation with gas chromatography coupled with electron capture detection (GCâ€“ECD). Data here represents the annual average for data reported in Montzka et al. (2018).

    The WMO (2003; 2010 and 2014) projections are those published by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and represent the global average expected rate of change in CFC-11 concentrations based on reported emissions of CFC-11 from all parties to the Montreal Protocol.
