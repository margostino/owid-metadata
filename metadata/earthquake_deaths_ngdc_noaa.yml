name: earthquake_deaths_ngdc_noaa
description: "Estimated number of deaths from earthquake events. This is estimated
    as the total number from the earthquake event plus secondary impacts (such as
    a tsunami triggered by an earthquake).\n\nA significant earthquake is classified
    as one that meets at least one of the following criteria: caused deaths, caused
    moderate damage (approximately $1 million or more), magnitude 7.5 or greater,
    Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) X or greater, or the earthquake generated a
    tsunami.\n\nOur World in Data have aggregated significant earthquake deaths by
    country/location per year. \n\nDue to data availability, reporting and evidence,
    it's expected that more recent data will be more complete than the long historical
    record."
