description: "For the estimated number of polio cases using Tebbens et al.’s 2010
    model:\r\nThe WHO’s dataset of reported polio cases from 1980 onwards (the first
    link above) is used to produce an estimate of the actual number of polio cases.
    An explanation of the correction factor algorithm can be found here: https://ourworldindata.org/tebbens-et-al-2011-estimation-of-the-number-of-paralytic-polio-cases/
    Part of the model input consists of the WHO’s surveillance system that can be
    found under the second link cited above. \r\n\r\n\r\nFor the estimated number
    of polio cases that disregard any reported cases after a country was certified
    polio-free and use Tebbens et al.’s (2010) model: \r\nThe WHO’s dataset from 1980
    onwards (the first link above) was modified by deleting all documented polio cases
    after the year in which polio ceased to be endemic in each country (see map and
    data here: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/the-decade-of-the-last-recorded-case-of-paralytic-polio-by-country).
    Then, Tebbens et al.’s  (2010) model is applied in the same way as for the “Estimated
    number of polio cases”, for which we provide an explanation here: https://ourworldindata.org/tebbens-et-al-2011-estimation-of-the-number-of-paralytic-polio-cases/."
