description: |-
    Data reports the share of people living in urban areas, as reported by the European Commission project. These results differ significantly from UN and nationally-defined figures based on differences in methodology.

    The European Commission combines high-resolution satellite imagery with national census data to derive its estimates of urban and rural settlements.

    The European Commission applied a universal definition of settlements across all countries:

    - Urban centre: must have a minimum of 50,000 inhabitants plus a population density of at least 1500 people per square kilometre (km2) or density of build-up area greater than 50 percent.
    - Urban cluster:Â must have a minimum of 5,000 inhabitants plus a population density of at least 300 people per square kilometre (km2).
    - Rural: fewer than 5,000 inhabitants.

    The urban share is thereafter defined as the sum of urban centres and urban clusters.
