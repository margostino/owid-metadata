description: "The share of people of living in poverty and extreme poverty is taken
    from Bourguignon and Morrison (2002), and ‘the poverty lines were calibrated so
    that poverty and extreme poverty headcounts in 1992 coincided roughly with estimates
    from other sources’. And in footnote they say ‘these definitions correspond to
    poverty lines equal to consumption per capita of $2 and $1 a day, expressed in
    1985 PPP.’\r\n\r\nTo this I added the share of people living living below the
    international poverty line which, since the revision in 2015, is $1.90 at 2011
    purchasing-power parity (PPP). The revisions in the definition of the poverty
    line and the PPP adjustment make the poverty figures in levels not comparable
    to earlier data – to illustrate this I have plotted both series for the time from
    1981 to 1992. The World Bank data was downloaded in October 2015."
