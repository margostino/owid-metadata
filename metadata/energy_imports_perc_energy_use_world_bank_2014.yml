description: '"Net energy imports are estimated as energy use less production, both
    measured in oil equivalents. A negative value indicates that the country is a
    net exporter. Energy use refers to use of primary energy before transformation
    to other end-use fuels, which is equal to indigenous production plus imports and
    stock changes, minus exports and fuels supplied to ships and aircraft engaged
    in international transport." (World Bank)'
