description: "The easiest way to illustrate the improvements in labor productivity
    in cotton spinning over time is to reproduce data on labor productivity from Catling’s
    study of The Spinning Mule, from which the measure of OHP (operative hours to
    process 100 lbs of cotton) is applied to other technologies, as shown. [Please
    see table 2 on page 20 for the original data.]\r\n\r\nCatling’s study of The Spinning
    Mule provides a historical introduction of the invention of the spinning mule
    in the 18th century. The spinning mule was worked by hand with the spinner manually
    controlled all its operations. It was around 1825 that Richard Roberts invented
    the ‘quadrant winding motion’ that enabled the machine to operate automatically.\r\n\r\nFull
