description: "Interviews took place at different points in time within and across
    countries. All interviews took place in the period 1999-2003. \r\n\r\nThe source
    provides the following information regarding the data-collecting process:\r\n\r\n\"Random
    samples of 250–435 adults were interviewed by telephone in five different nations
    (N = 1,546): Belgium, Germany, Italy, the UK, and the United States. The interview
    included questions on respondent attitudes, knowledge, and opinions regarding
    homelessness; respondents’ own personal experiences with homelessness and homeless
    people; and demographic characteristics of the respondents.\r\n\r\nRespondents’
    personal experiences with homelessness were assessed by querying whether they
    had ever considered themselves homeless or in another precarious housing situation,
    following up with items directed at ascertaining the age at which they experienced
    homelessness, the duration of the episode of homelessness, and whether they were
    literally homeless (slept in a shelter, in a park) or 'precariously housed' (slept
    at a friend’s house because they had no other place to go).\"\r\n\r\nWe report
    estimates only for literal homelessness."
