name: government_expenditure_and_learning_outcomes
description: "This dataset was compiled to compare the government expenditure per
    primary student ($PPP) with learning outcomes. Because of the patchy nature of
    the government expenditure data as obtained from the World Bank EdStats Dataset,
    the most recent available expenditure data were used while 2006 was used as a
    cut-off point. \n\nThe measure of learning outcome used is the share of students
    either achieving or not achieving a minimum proficiency benchmark. Achievement
    outcomes come from standardized, psychometrically-robust international and regional
    tests. In order to maximize coverage by country, tests have been harmonized and
    pooled across subjects (math, reading, science) and levels (primary and secondary
    education). Higher proficiency benchmarks that represent the missing share of
    100% are students that reached intermediate or advanced proficiency levels. See
    source for details on proficiency benchmarks. "
