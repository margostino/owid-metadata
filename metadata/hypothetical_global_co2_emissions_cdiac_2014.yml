description: "Data is based on the hypothetical scenario where the total global population
    had the same carbon dioxide production footprint as the average citizen of a given
    country.\r\n\r\nFigures were derived by multiplying the average per capita CO2
    footprint (sourced from CDIAC, referenced below) in 2014, by the UN estimated
    global population in 2014 of 7,265,786,000.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\nCarbon Dioxide
