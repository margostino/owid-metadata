description: "Data measures global freshwater use which is the sum of water withdrawals
    for agriculture, industrial and domestic uses. Data from 1900-2010 is sourced
    from the IGB Programme (full reference below). Global data has been extended to
    2014 by combining with 2014 'World' figures as reported in the World Bank - World
    Development Indicators, under the variable \"Annual Freshwater Withdrawals, Total
    (billion cubic meters)\". Available at: http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators
    [accessed 2017-11-08].\n\nData from 1900-2010 is sourced from the IGB Database.
    IGB's data is estimated using the WaterGAP model from Flörke et al. 2013 (full
    reference below). Data is available at aggregates in OECD, BRICS and Rest of the
    World (ROW). OECD members are defined as countries who were members in 2010 and
    their membership was carried back in time. BRICS countries are Brazil, Russia,
    India, China and South Africa.\n\nFull references:\nAlcamo, J., Döll, P., Henrichs,
