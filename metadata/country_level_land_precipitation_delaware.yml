name: country_level_land_precipitation_delaware
description: Country-level values were created by averaging all grid cells whose centroids
    were within the border of a country. Area weighted measures were weighted by the
    area of the grid cell when averaging the grid cells and population weighted averages
    used gridded population data from 2015 created by the Center for International
    Earth Science Information Network - CIESIN (http://dx.doi.org/10.7927/H4X63JVC).
