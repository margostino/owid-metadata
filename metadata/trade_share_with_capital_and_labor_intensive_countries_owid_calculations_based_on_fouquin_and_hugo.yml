description: "Capital and labor-intensive countries have been defined according to
    the World Bankâ€™s 2016 income classifications as our starting point. Low and lower-middle
    income countries have been classified as labor-intensive while upper-middle income
    and high income countries as capital-intensive. The 2016 classification has been
    applied to all previous years for which there is data available. Where no World
    Bank classification is available for self-governing territories, the observation
    is assigned the country classification to which it is related. For example, Saint
    Pierre and Miquelon would be assigned France's income classification. \n\nAll
    countries defined to be resource rich have been excluded from the sample to focus
    on the trade between rich countries and countries that are labor-abundant but
    capital and resource poor. The list of resource rich countries excluded are: the
    Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia, Niger, Guinea, Mali, Chad, Mauritania,
    Laos, Zambia, Vietnam, Yemen, Nigeria, Cameroon, Papua New Guinea, Sudan, Uzbekistan,
    Cote d'Ivoire, Bolivia, Mongolia, Congo, Iraq, Indonesia, Timor, Syria, Guyana,
    Turkmenistan, Angola, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea. The list is taken from the IMF
    resource: https://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2012/082412.pdf on page 48, Appendix
    1, Table 1. \n\nTo calculate export trade share to labor-intensive countries,
    using the UK as an example, figures have been calculated as follows:\nUK-exports-to-labor-intensive-countries-as-share-of-GDP
    = [exports-to-A + exports-to-B + exports-to-C] / GDP-of-UK (this calculation would
    assume there are a total of three labor-intensive countries in the entire sample).
    \n\nExport values used rely on the estimate given by the importer as the authors
    note: \" importers have a greater incentive to properly assess trade flows as
    they are commonly subject to duties\". Bilateral trade flows are recorded in current
    British pounds.\n\nWest Germany estimates have been used between 1950 - 1990,
    and Germany's trade estimates used before 1950 and after 1990.  Estimates for
    East Germany have been excluded. Please see the original document providing a
    detailed description of the data set used, including country and territory definitions,
    available at: http://www.cepii.fr/CEPII/fr/publications/wp/abstract.asp?NoDoc=9134\n\nMicronesia,
    Marshall Islands, Monaco, Montenegro, San Marino, and the Bahamas have also been
    excluded from the sample due to insufficient data availability.  "
