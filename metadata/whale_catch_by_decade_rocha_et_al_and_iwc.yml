description: |-
    Data is presented as decadal totals where '1900' is equal to the total catch from 1900 to 1909; '1910' is from 1910 to 1919 etc. For the decade '2010', only the years 2010 to 2015 are currently included.

    Data on whale catch is sourced from two sources:

    Figures over the 20th century (1900-1999) is from: Rocha, R. C., Clapham, P. J., & Ivashchenko, Y. V. (2014). Emptying the oceans: a summary of industrial whaling catches in the 20th century. Marine Fisheries Review, 76(4), 37-48.

    The above paper draws on data originally published by the International Whaling Commission (IWC).

    Data from 2000 onwards is sourced directly from the International Whaling Commissions (IWC) which recorded the number of catches at: https://iwc.int/catches.
