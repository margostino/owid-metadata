description: "The Wellcome Global Monitor is the worldâ€™s largest study into how people
    around the world think and feel about science and major health challenges. It
    surveys over 140,000 people from more than 140 countries. \n\nSurvey respondents
    were asked:\n(1) Do you strongly or somewhat agree, strongly or somewhat disagree
    or neither agree nor disagree with the following statements? 'Vaccines are important
    for children to have'.\n\n(2) Do you strongly or somewhat agree, strongly or somewhat
    disagree or neither agree nor disagree with the following statement? 'Vaccines
    are safe.'\n\n(3) Do you strongly or somewhat agree, strongly or somewhat disagree
    or neither agree nor disagree with the following statement? 'Vaccines are effective'.\n\nFor
    each question we have calculated the \"share of people who agree\" to be the sum
    of those who \"strongly agree\" and \"somewhat agree\"; and the \"share of people
    who disagree\" to be the sum of those who \"strongly disagree\" and \"somewhat
    disagree\"."
