description: |-
    Data on global land use breakdown was developed based on land cover figures published by the UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), available at its statistical database: http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#home [accessed 10th October 2017].

    Global land use breakdown data has also been visualised and published at: https://ourworldindata.org/yields-and-land-use-in-agriculture/#breakdown-of-global-land-area-today

    Here, we have attempted to visualise the extent of global land surface area equivalent to each land cover category using World Bank country area figures.

    For example, the surface of North America, Latin America and the Caribbean combined is approximately equivalent to the areal extent of global forests.
