description: |-
    Solar photovoltaic (PV) data for the years 1976-2009 are sourced from Lafond et al. (2017). The authors sourced this data from the Navigant Research series (https://www.navigantresearch.com/).

    Our World in Data have extended this series up to 2019 based on the latest data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) Resource, which reports global solar PV installed capacity and solar PV model prices. Available at: http://resourceirena.irena.org/gateway/dashboard/
    https://www.irena.org/publications/2020/Jun/Renewable-Power-Costs-in-2019

    IRENA presents solar PV module price series for a number of different module technologies. Here we have adopted the series for Thin film a-Si/u-Si, which it adopts as the Global Index.

    Prices from LaFond et al. (2017) have been converted to 2019 US$ using the US GDP deflator: https://www.multpl.com/gdp-deflator/table/by-year
