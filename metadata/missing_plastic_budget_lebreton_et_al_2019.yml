description: |-
    Data describes modelled and projected ocean plastic under three 'plastic emissions' scenarios.

    Given is the modelled global accumulation of buoyant macroplastics (>0.5 cm) in the ocean. And the accumulation of microplastics (<0.5 cm), which is degraded plastic material from the ocean surface layer.

    This is given under three scenarios:
    (1) Emissions of plastic to the world's oceans stopped by 2020;
    (2) Emissions stagnated at 2020 levels;
    (3) Increasing emissions of plastic until 2050 in line with the average growth rate of global plastic production from 2005-2015.
