description: "This dataset aggregates the number of conflicts per year (by conflict
    type and region) listed in UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset version 21.1.\n\nConflicts
    within this dataset refer only to 'State-based' conflicts. UCDP defines state-based
    armed conflict as: “a contested incompatibility that concerns\ngovernment and/or
    territory where the use of armed force between two parties, of which at least
    one is the government of a state, results in at least 25 battle-related deaths
    in a calendar year.”\n\nThe conflict is listed in all years that the 25 deaths
    threshold is met (but not otherwise).\n\nThe data is organised by year and conflict.
    We aggregate this to provide the number of conflicts in each year, broken down
    by the conflict type and region. \nThis dataset runs from 1946 and aims to have
    global coverage over this period. Accordingly, we add a zero deaths observation
    for year-region-conflict type combinations that do appear in the dataset.\n\nThe
    labels for the conflict types we have used paraphrase UCDP/PRIO's technical definitions
    of 'Extrasystemic', 'Internal', 'Internationalised internal' and 'Interstate'.\n\nNote
    that in this dataset the location refers not (necessarily) to where fighting and
    deaths took place, but rather to the location of the 'incompatibility' between
    the participants that defines the conflict: usually the country or territory whose
    possession or governance is in dispute.\n"
