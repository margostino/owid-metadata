name: global_death_rates_from_disasters_emdat_un_and_hyde
description: |-
    Disaster-related deaths from EMDAT (OFDA/CRED International Disaster Database) have been normalised by OurWorldinData to global population size based on HYDE (1900-1949) & UN (1950 onwards) population estimates. This provides data in terms of deaths per 100,000 people.

    The data presented here includes all categories classified as "natural disasters" (distinguished from technological disasters, such as oil spills and industrial accidents). This includes those from drought, floods, extreme weather, extreme temperature, landslides, dry mass movements, wildfires, volcanic activity and earthquakes.

    The combined set of "all natural disasters" also includes disasters defined as "insect infestations", however this has not been included as a discrete dataset due to low impact numbers.
