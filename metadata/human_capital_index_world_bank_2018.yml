description: "The Human Capital Index (HCI) combines indicators of health and education
    into a measure of the human capital that a child born today can expect to obtain
    by her 18th birthday, given the risks of poor education and health that prevail
    in the country where she lives. The HCI is measured in units of productivity relative
    to a benchmark of complete education and full health, and ranges from 0 to 1.
    A value of x on the HCI indicates that a child born today can expect to be only
    x x100 percent as productive as a future worker as she would be if she enjoyed
    complete education and full health. \n\nRanging between 0 and 1, the index takes
    the value 1 only if a child born today can expect to achieve full\nhealth (defined
    as no stunting and survival up to at least age 60) and complete her education
    potential\n(defined as 14 years of high-quality school by age 18). \n\nHCI is
    calculated based on the metrics of probability of survival to age 5, expected
    years of school, harmonized test scores, learning-adjusted years of schooling,
    stunting and adult survival rates."
