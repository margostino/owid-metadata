description: "The only data not taken from the maps but from the text are the data
    for Canada, USA, Australia and New Zealand: For Canada the authors reported that
    “endemic smallpox was eliminated by 1944”, for the USA only that it was eliminated
    “the latter half of the 1940s” (I chose 1948 for the visualization). Dates for
    the last outbreaks of smallpox in Australia (1917) and New Zealand (1914) are
    reported in the text – in both countries smallpox has always been rare. \r\n\r\nThe
    dates for Madagascar and Namibia are not exactly known – the authors only report
    that smallpox was eradicated in Madagascar before 1918 and for Namibia before
    1955 (so I chose these years for eradication). \r\n\r\nCountries are shown in
    their current borders – successor countries of Yugoslavia, the USSR and the Sudan
    are assigned the eradication date of these states: 1925 for Yugoslavia, 1936 for
    the USSR, and 1972 for the Sudan."
