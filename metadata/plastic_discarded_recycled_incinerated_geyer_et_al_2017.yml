name: plastic_discarded_recycled_incinerated_geyer_et_al_2017
description: "Estimates of the proportion of plastic waste discarded, recycled and
    incinerated based on data in Geyer et al. (2017).\n\nGeyer et al. (2017) note
    an average linear rate of increase in recycling of 0.7% per year from 1990 onwards,
    and 0.7% per year for incineration from 1980 onwards. \n\nData for 1980-2015 is
    based on historical estimates. Data from 2016-2050 is based solely on extrapolation
    of consistent growth trends of 0.7% for recycling and incineration; it therefore
    represents business-as-usual growth but should not be interpreted as a direct
    projection."
