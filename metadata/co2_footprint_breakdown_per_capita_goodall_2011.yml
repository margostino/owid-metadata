name: co2_footprint_breakdown_per_capita_goodall_2011
description: The data sourced from Chris Goodall's book is representative of the composition
    of the average carbon footprint in the United Kingdom at the time of writing (reprinted
    in 2011). Significant variability between individual lifestyles in the UK, and
    across comparable high-income countries is to be expected. This breakdown does
    not include estimates of per capita contribution to national services, manufacturing
    and infrastructure; Goodall estimated this additional component to comprise approximately
    35% of an individual's footprint.
