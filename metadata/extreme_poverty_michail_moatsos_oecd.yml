description: "The share in extreme poverty, estimated by Michail Moatsos based on
    the 'cost of basic needs'-approach.\n\nThe ‘cost of basic needs’-approach was
    recommended by the ‘World Bank Commission on Global Poverty’, headed by Tony Atkinson,
    as a complementary method in measuring poverty.\n\nTony Atkinson – and after his
    death his colleagues – turned this report into a book that was published as Anthony
    B. Atkinson (2019) – Measuring Poverty around the World. You find more information
    on Atkinson’s website.\n\nThe CBN-approach Moatsos’ work is based on was suggested
    by Allen in Robert Allen (2017) – Absolute poverty: When necessity displaces desire.
    In American Economic Review, Vol. 107/12, pp. 3690-3721, https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20161080
    \n\nMoatsos describes the methodology as follows: “In this approach, poverty lines
    are calculated for every year and country separately, rather than using a single
    global line. The second step is to gather the necessary data to operationalise
    this approach, alongside imputation methods in cases where not all the necessary
    data are available. The third step is to devise a method for aggregating countries’
    poverty estimates on a global scale to account for countries that lack some of
    the relevant data.” In his publication – linked above – you find much more detail
    on all of the shown poverty data.\n"
