name: tetanus_neonatal_rate_calculated_from_who_incidence_2017_and_wdi_population_data_hannah_behren
description: "Neonatal tetanus incidence per 1,000,000 people based on WHO neonatal
    tetanus incidence dataset 2017 (already on grapher) and WDI total population dataset
    (already on grapher). \n\nNo population data was available for Niue (all years),
    Kuwait (1992-1994), Eritrea (2013-2016). The neonatal tetanus incidence was zero.
    Population size does therefore not matter to calculate the rate, as it will be
    zero regardless of the population size.\n\nNo population data was available for
    Swaziland (all years) and (Serbia 1980-1989). They were therefore excluded."
