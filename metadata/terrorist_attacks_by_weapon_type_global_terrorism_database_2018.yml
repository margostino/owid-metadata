description: "The general weapon used in a given terrorist attack is recorded in the
    following categories:\n\n1 = Biological\nA weapon whose components are produced
    from pathogenic microorganisms or toxic substances of biological origins.\n\n2
    = Chemical\nA weapon produced from toxic chemicals that is contained in a delivery
    system and dispersed as a liquid, vapor, or aerosol. This category includes chemical
    weapons delivered via explosive device.\n\n3 = Radiological\nA weapon whose components
    are produced from radioactive materials that emit ionizing radiation and can take
    many forms.\n\n4 = Nuclear\nA weapon which draws its explosive force from fission,
    fusion, or a combination of these methods.\n\n5 = Firearms\nA weapon which is
    capable of firing a projectile using an explosive charge as a propellant.\n\n6
    = Explosives\nA weapon composed of energetically unstable material undergoing
    rapid decomposition and releasing a pressure wave that causes physical damage
    to the surrounding environment. Note that chemical weapons delivered via explosive
    are classified as “Chemical” with weapon subtype “Explosives.”\n\n7 = Fake Weapons\nA
    weapon that was claimed by the perpetrator at the time of the incident to be real
    but was discovered after-the-fact to be non-existent or incapable of producing
    the desired effects.\n\n8 = Incendiary\nA weapon that is capable of catching fire,
    causing fire, or burning readily and produces intensely hot fire when exploded.\n\n9
    = Melee\nA weapon—targeting people rather than property—that does not involve
    a projectile in which the user and target are in contact with it simultaneously.\n\n10
    = Vehicle\nAn automobile that is used in an incident that does not incorporate
    the use of explosives such as a car bomb or truck bomb.\n\n11 = Sabotage Equipment\nA
    weapon that is used in the demolition or destruction of property (e.g., removing
    bolts from a train tracks).\n\n12 = Other\nA weapon that has been identified but
    does not fit into one of the above categories.\n\n13 = Unknown\nThe weapon type
    cannot be determined from the available information. "
