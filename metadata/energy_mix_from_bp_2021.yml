description: |-
    Raw data on energy consumption is sourced from the BP Statistical Review of World Energy. Available at: https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy.html

    Primary energy in exajoules (EJ) has been converted to TWh by Our World in Data based on a conversion factor of 277.778.

    Each source's share of energy based on the "substitution method" were calculated by Our World in Data by taking all energy sources' energy normalised to EJ – this takes account of the inefficiencies in fossil fuel production and is a better approximation of "final energy" consumption.

    Additional metrics have been calculated by Our World in Data:
    – Annual change in energy consumption by source: this is calculated as the difference from the previous year
    – % of total primary energy: calculated as each source's share of primary energy from all sources
    – Per capita energy by source: calculated as primary energy consumption by source, divided by population.

    Per capita figures have been calculated using a population dataset that is built and maintained by Our World in Data, based on different sources:
