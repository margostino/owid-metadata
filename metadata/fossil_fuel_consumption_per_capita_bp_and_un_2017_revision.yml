description: "Per capita trends in fossil fuel consumption were calculated by OWID
    based on population data from the UN Population Division, and national fossil
    fuel data - coal, oil, and natural gas - from BP's Statistical Review of Global
    Energy.\r\n\r\nPer capita consumption was calculated by dividing total population
    in any given year by a country or region's coal, oil or gas consumption.\r\n\r\nPopulation
    data was sourced from the UN Population Division (2017 Revision). Available at:
    https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/DataQuery/ [accessed 17th October 2017].\r\n\r\nFossil
    fuel consumption data was sourced from the BP's Statistical Review of Global Energy.
