name: risk_attribution_of_cancer_deaths_to_tobacco_smoking_ihme
description: IHME, Global Burden of Disease provide figures on disease burden and
    deaths attributed to a range of environmental and lifestyle risk factors. Here
    data from IHME represents the age-standardized cancer death rate (per 100,000
    individuals) and share of total cancer deaths attributed to tobacco smoking (which
    is inclusive of smoking and secondhand smoke). This impact is measured across
    total cancer types.
