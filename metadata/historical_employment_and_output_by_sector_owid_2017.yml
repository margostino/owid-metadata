name: historical_employment_and_output_by_sector_owid_2017
description: Observations in this dataset correspond to the data published by Herrendorf,
    Rogerson, and Valentinyi (2014), except in some cases where we have updated observation
    using new releases of the same underlying data sources. The most important update
    corresponds to the 2015 release of the Groningen Growth and Development Centre’s
    (GGDC) 10-sector database. However, some other country-specific updates were also
    considered (e.g. US data published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis). In the
    attached documentation (https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Documentation-for-Historical-employment-and-output-by-sector-%E2%80%93-OWID-2017.pdf)
    we describe sources and updates, country by country.
