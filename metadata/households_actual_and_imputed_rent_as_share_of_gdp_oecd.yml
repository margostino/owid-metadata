name: households_actual_and_imputed_rent_as_share_of_gdp_oecd
description: The OECD collects National Accounts data from member states and a limited
    number of non-member states. Within the 'Final consumption expenditure of households'
    tables, it provides a breakdown of household final expenditure by purpose, according
    to the COICOP classification (Classification of Individual Consumption According
    to Purpose). This includes actual and imputed rent. Imputed rent is an estimate
    of the rent foregone by home owners in living in their own property, rather than
    renting it out.
