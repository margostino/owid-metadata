description: "The data file used is called “Life Expectancy at exact age x (ex) -
    Both Sexes” on the website given under “Mortality indicators”. This original data
    file has life expectancy at multiple ages for every country and different regions.
    We use only the countries and “World” data for age 10.\r\nEach country has a life
    table from which we extracted the life expectancy at age 10 (column ex, row where
    Age is 10 for each country.)\r\nWe combined the information from the UN Population
    Division (UNPD) and the Human Mortality Database (HMD) using an R script. In the
    final data set, UNPD values are used for 1950-2100, and HMD values are used pre-1950,
    where available. The data set uses the first year of the period to graph the data,
    i.e. the e10 value for 1950-1954 is graphed at 1950.\r\n\r\nWe omitted data from
    the first period for which data is available for each country, because often this
    first period was not a full 5 years long. For instance, the life table for Australia
    begins with the 4-year period 1921-1924, and every subsequent period is a full
    5 years long. With data manipulation or extrapolation, this first data point can
    be included in the future."
