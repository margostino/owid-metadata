description: "The Palmer Drought Severity Index is the most widely used index to measure
    drought severity over time. is calculated from precipitation and temperature measurements
    at weather stations. An index value of zero represents the average moisture conditions
    observed between 1931 and 1990 at a given location. A positive value means conditions
    are wetter than average, while a negative value is drier than average. \n\nIndex
    values from locations across US have been averaged together to produce the national
    or regional values.\n\nPositive values represent wetter-than-average conditions,
    while negative values represent drier-than-average conditions. A value between
    -2 and -3 indicates moderate drought, -3 to -4 is severe drought, and -4 or below
    indicates extreme drought."
