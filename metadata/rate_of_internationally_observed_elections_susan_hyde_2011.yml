name: rate_of_internationally_observed_elections_susan_hyde_2011
description: "International election monitoring can be defined as the observation
    of an election by one or more independent parties, typically from another country
    or non-governmental organization (NGO). Election observers primarily assess the
    conduct of elections and factors influencing the prevailing electoral environment.
    As Hyde (2011) notes \"nearly 80 percent of all national elections are now monitored\".
    For further background information see Hyde's 2011 paper referenced above.\n\nThe
    percent of observed and criticized elections was calculated as:\n\n% observed
    and criticized elections = (no.of criticized elections/ total no. of elections)
    * 100\n\nThe percent of observed and not criticized elections was calculated as:\n\n%
    observed and not criticized elections = [(no. of observed elections - no. of criticized
    elections)/total number of elections] * 100\n \nCountries excluded from the analysis
    are microstates and the five independent states that did not hold any direct national
    elections between 1960 and 2006: China, Eritrea, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the
    United Arab Emirates."
