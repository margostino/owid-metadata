description: "Please note that for some countries the Chartbook includes additional
    time series for economic inequality.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Chartbook is to
    present consistent time-series for each country over time. Unfortunately there
    are important cases in which the comparability between countries is limited. The
    table below lists the definition of the Gini time series for each country and
    differences in definitions should be taken into account when making cross-country
    comparisons.\r\n\r\nThe addition of series x behind the definition indicates that
    there are several Gini time-series available for this country in the Chartbook
    and they can be found at the country page there.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nArgentina Gini
