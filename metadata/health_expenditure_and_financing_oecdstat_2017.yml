description: "Per capita health expenditure here is measured in 2010 international
    dollars.\r\n\r\nThe definition of health spending given by the OECD is the following:
    \"Health spending measures the final consumption of health care goods and services
    (i.e. current health expenditure) including personal health care (curative care,
    rehabilitative care, long-term care, ancillary services and medical goods) and
    collective services (prevention and public health services as well as health administration),
    but excluding spending on investments. Health care is financed through a mix of
    financing arrangements including government spending and compulsory health insurance
    (“public”) as well as voluntary health insurance and private funds such as households’
    out-of-pocket payments, NGOs and private corporations (“private”). This indicator
    is presented as a total and by type of financing (“public”, “private”, “out-of-pocket”)
    and is measured as a share of GDP, as a share of total health spending and in
    USD per capita (using economy-wide PPPs).\""
