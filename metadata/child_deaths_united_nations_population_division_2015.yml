description: "– The original data is presented in 1,000s live births. Here it was
    multiplied by 1,000 for this reason.\r\n\r\n– Importantly data refer to 5 year
    intervals around the indicated year. E.g. 1952 refers to 1950-1954 in the original
    dataset. Here the value for the 5 year interval is divided by 5 and attributed
    to the mid-year of the interval."
