description: "Dataset derived through the combination of percentage electricity access
    statistics and UN population figures.\r\n\r\nThe absolute number of people with
    and without access to improved water sources was derived by multiplying the percentage
    of the global population with access to improved water sources (from World Bank,
    World Development Indicators) by United Nations figures on global population in
    any given year.\r\n\r\nAs defined by the World Bank: \"improved drinking water
    source includes piped water on premises (piped household water connection located
    inside the userâ€™s dwelling, plot or yard), and other improved drinking water sources
    (public taps or standpipes, tube wells or boreholes, protected dug wells, protected
    springs, and rainwater collection).\"\r\n\r\nAccess to improved water sources
    (%) data was derived from World Bank World Development Indicators (WDI). Available
