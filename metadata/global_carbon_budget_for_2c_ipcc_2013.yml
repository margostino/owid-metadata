name: global_carbon_budget_for_2c_ipcc_2013
description: "The carbon budget refers to the maximum quantity of carbon which can
    be released to maintain a 50 percent probability of global average temperature
    rise remaining below two-degrees celcius (the target set within the UN Paris climate
    agreement).\r\n\r\nThis has been measured relative to the quantity of carbon which
    would be released if all fossil fuel reserves were burned without the use of carbon
    capture and storage (CCS) technology. The difference between the two is defined
    as 'unburnable carbon'.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate
