description: "Additional info on Homelessness data:\r\n\r\nHUD's description of the
    report:\r\n\r\n\"The Annual Homeless Assessment Report (AHAR) is a HUD report
    to the U.S. Congress that provides nationwide estimates of homelessness, including
    information about the demographic characteristics of homeless persons, service
    use patterns, and the capacity to house homeless persons. The report is based
    primarily on Homeless Management Information Systems (HMIS) data about persons
    who experience homelessness during a 12-month period\".\r\n\r\nAll HUD reports
    are available at https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/hdx/guides/ahar/#reports.\r\n\r\n
    \r\n\r\nAdditional info on Population data:\r\n\r\nAs explained by their Guidance
    for Data: \"the Census Bureauâ€™s Population Estimates Program (PEP) releases several
    different data series over the course of each decade\". \r\n\r\nTotal U.S. population
    figures for the period 2007-2010 are taken from the 'Intercensal Estimates 2000-2010'.
    Each decade, PEP releases these 'Intercensal Estimates' which constitutes the
    preferred data series for the decade.  \r\n\r\nTotal U.S. population figures for
    the period 2011-2016 are taken from the 'National Population Totals Tables: 2010-2016'.
    These estimates \"are produced using a similar procedure to that used for our
    current postcensal estimates series, and with no knowledge of the Census count
    at the end of the decade.\""
