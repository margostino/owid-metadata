name: births_outside_of_marriage
description: Data for Australia, Japan, Korea and New Zealand refer to ex-nuptial/out-of-wedlock
    births, that is, where the child's parents are not registered as married to each
    other (or, for New Zealand only, in a civil union with each other) at the time
    of the birth. For all other countries, data refer to births to mothers where the
    mother's marital status at the time of birth was other than married. For Canada,
    births to mothers whose marital status is other than married as a proportion of
    births where the mother's marital status is recorded. In 2017, the mother's marital
    status was not recorded on 8% of births. For Mexico, births to mothers whose civil
    status is other than married as a proportion of births where the mother's civil
    status is recorded. In 2017, the mother's civil status was not recorded on 8%
    of births. For Israel, data refer to births to unmarried Jewish women as a proportion
    of all births to Jewish women, only.
