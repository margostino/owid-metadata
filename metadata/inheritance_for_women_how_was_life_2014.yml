description: "Gendered inheritance practices for immovables in 1920 are obtained from
    the Murdock data, while 1980 and 2000 are from the World Bank.\n\nInformation
    on inheritance practices at the start of the 20th century comes from George Murdock’s
    Ethnographic Atlas (1969).  To compare Murdock's figures to contemporary data
    available from the World Bank’s Fifty Years of Women’s Legal Rights database,
    a dichotomous scheme had to be used where 0 indicates inequality and 1 equality.\n\nFor
    further information of these data, see the link above from page 221, under the
    heading \"Historical sources\". "
