    Livestock conversion efficiencies are given as reported in Alexander et al. (2016). Alexander, P., Brown, C., Arneth, A., Finnigan, J., & Rounsevell, M. D. (2016).

    'Feed conversion ratio' is defined as the quantity of feed inputs required to produce one kilogram of edible product. This is measured in kilograms of dry-matter feed per kilogram of edible weight product.

    Protein and energy efficiency are both measured as the percentage of protein or energy converted from feed to animal product.
