description: "This dataset provides information on nuclear weapons states, using data
    from Bleek (2017), which we double-checked with information from the Nuclear Threat
    Initiative (2022) for recent years.\n\nThe dataset distinguishes between countries
    not considering (score 0), considering (score of 1), pursuing (score 2), possessing
    nuclear weapons (score 3). \n\nA country is coded as not considering nuclear weapons
    if it neither considers, pursues, or possesses nuclear weapons.\n\nA country is
    coded as considering nuclear weapons if its leaders explore whether it is possible
    and desirable for them to attempt to acquire nuclear weapons, or they work to
    increase their nuclear weapons capabilities, but without launching a dedicated
    program.\n\nA country is coded as pursuing nuclear weapons if it has an active
    program to acquire nuclear weapons or to obtain the ability to construct them
    on short notice.\n\nA country is coded as possessing nuclear weapons if it has
    a nuclear-explosive device that it can deliver. Conducting an explosive nuclear
    test is therefore neither sufficient nor nor necessary.\n\nBelarus, Kazakhstan,
    and Ukraine are not coded as possessing nuclear weapons because they never had
    operational control of the nuclear weapons left over from the Soviet Union.\n\nYou
    can read more about specific countries in the profiles by Bleek (2017) and the
    Nuclear Threat Initiative (2022) by following the links."
