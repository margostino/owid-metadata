description: "The total value of exports calculated for the NBER-United Nations Datasets
    includes only trade in goods, classified according to the 4 digit Standard International
    Trade Classification, Revision 2. Authors give primacy to importers' reports whenever
    they are available, assumed to be more accurate.\r\n\r\nOWID calculations have
    excluded all observations for the 'World' with the focus on bilateral country
    trade flows. Countries Comoros, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and the Netherlands Antilles
    have also been excluded from the sample as, in the case of the former two, multiple
    countries are included in these labels in the NBER-UN data, and hence would be
    inaccurate to calculate the trade share by national GDP. For the Netherlands Antilles
    there is insufficient alternative trade data by the World Bank and other sources
    to check whether the figures are correctly estimated. \r\n\r\nThe United Kingdom
    consists of: the UK, British Antarctic Territories, the Falkland Islands, and
    Saint Helena. \r\nGermany consists of: East Germany, West Germany, and Germany.
    \r\nRussia: the former USSR and Russia. \r\nFrance: French Guinea, Guadeloupe,
    Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and France. \r\nYemen: the Yemen Arab Republic, the
    Yemen People's Republic, and Yemen. \r\n\r\nAll countries defined to be resource
    rich have been excluded from the sample. The list of these countries include:
    the Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia, Niger, Guinea, Mali, Chad, Mauritania,
    Laos, Zambia, Vietnam, Yemen, Nigeria, Cameroon, Papua New Guinea, Sudan, Uzbekistan,
    Cote d'Ivoire, Bolivia, Mongolia, Congo, Iraq, Indonesia, Timor, Syria, Guyana,
    Turkmenistan, Angola, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea. The list is taken from the IMF
    resource: https://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2012/082412.pdf on page 48, Appendix
    1, Table 1. \r\n\r\nCapital vs labor intensive countries have been categorised
    using the World Bank's 2016 income classification. Low and lower-middle income
    countries have been classified as labor intensive while upper-middle and high-income
    countries as capital intensive. The 2016 classification has been applied to all
    previous years for which there is data.\r\n\r\nTo calculate export trade share
    to labor-intensive countries, using the UK as an example, figures have been calculated
    as follows:\r\nUK-exports-to-labor-intensive-countries-as-share-of-GDP = [exports-to-A
    + exports-to-B + exports-to-C] / GDP-of-UK (this calculation would assume there
    are a total of three developing countries in the entire sample)."
