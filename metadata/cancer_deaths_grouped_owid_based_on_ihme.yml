name: cancer_deaths_grouped_owid_based_on_ihme
description: "Total annual number of deaths from cancers (termed 'Neoplasms' within
    the IHME, Global Burden of Disease Study). This measures cancer deaths across
    both sexes and all ages.\r\n\r\nSmaller categories of cancer types have been grouped
    by Our World in Data into a collective category 'Other cancers'. This grouping
    was set based on cancer types with global annual deaths in 2016 under 100,000.
    This includes testicular, Hodgkin lymphoma, mesothelioma, thyroid, non-melanoma
    skin cancer, nasopharynx, malignant skin melanoma, uterine cancer, and multiple
    myeloma."
