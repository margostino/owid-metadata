description: "The Multinational Time Use Study (MTUS) compiles a cross-nationally
    harmonised set of time use surveys where recorded variables have been comparably
    recoded. Activities are sorted into 24 categories for the population aged between
    21-65. We restrict our sample to working-age adults to minimise the role of time
    allocation decisions with a strong inter-temporal component following <a href=\"https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/55560/1/508634636.pdf\"
    rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Aguiar and Hurst (2006)</a>. \n\nThe following
    methodology was used to arrive at the minutes spent across the 24 recorded activities:\n<ul>\n<li>Using
    the MTUS simple dataset, the sample was restricted to individuals aged between
    21-65.</li>\n<li>The minutes spent on each activity were weighted by the ‘propwt’
    variable which brings the sample in line with the population from which it was
    drawn and ensures only good quality diaries are used. More information on the
    construction of ‘propwt’ can be found here: https://www.timeuse.org/sites/default/files/9727/chapter-5-weights-in-mtus.pdf
    </li>\n<li>To calculate the mean number of minutes spent on an activity in a country
    in a given year, we took an average of the number of minutes spent on each of
    the 24 activities reported by the diarists. All diary entries where no minutes
    are recorded for a certain activity are treated as missing and are not included
    in the calculated average. <a href=\"https://www.timeuse.org/sites/default/files/9727/mtus-user-guide-r9-february-2016.pdf\"
    rel=\"noopener\" target\"_blank\">Gershuny and Fisher (2016)</a> mention \"it
    is impossible to say for certain if [entries of zero minutes] is because the diarist
    did not do the activity or if the diarist actually did undertake the activity
    but did not report it in the diary\". Therefore, estimates should be interpreted
    as an upper bound for the average number of minutes spent on an activity by those
    diarists who have reported taking part in an activity.</li>\n<li>The data is normalised
    to 1440 minutes per day. In other words, countries for which time use does not
    sum to 1440 minutes after weighting and averaging, the missing minutes are equally
    distributed across all activities. </li>\n</ul>\n\nPlease see Table 1.1 for a
    list of all the surveys and years included and Table 1.2 for technical information
    on each time use survey: https://www.timeuse.org/sites/default/files/9727/mtus-user-guide-r9-february-2016.pdf"
