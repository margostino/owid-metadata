description: "The authors present a global assessment of archaeological expert knowledge
    on land use from 10,000 years before the present (yr B.P.) to 1850 CE. \n\nTo
    assess and integrate archaeological knowledge toward synthesis at a global scale,
    the ArchaeoGLOBE Project used a crowdsourcing approach. Archaeologists with land-use
    expertise were invited to contribute to a detailed questionnaire describing levels
    of land-use knowledge at 10 time intervals across 146 regional analytical units
    covering all continents except Antarctica. Contributors selected individual regions
    where they had expertise; 255 individual archaeologists completed a total of 711
    regional questionnaires, resulting in complete, though uneven, global coverage.
    The result is an expert-based meta-analysis that uses semi-subjective (ranked)
    survey data to generate regional assessments of land use over time.\n\nThey map
    the dating and extent of four 'agricultural' regimes across the world:\n1) Foraging:
    Foraging/hunting/gathering/fishing - subsistence based on hunting wild animals,
    gathering wild plants, and fishing, without deliberately modifying the reproduction
    of plants and animals that people exploit.\n2) Pastoralism: the exploitation of
    pasturelands for animal husbandry - including the breeding, care, and use of domesticated
    herd animals (e.g., sheep, goats, camels, cattle, horses, llamas, reindeer, and
    yaks).\n3) Extensive agriculture: swidden/shifting cultivation and other forms
    of noncontinuous cultivation.\n4) Intensive agriculture: all other forms of continuous
    cultivation (including irrigated and nonirrigated annual cropping, tropical agroforestry,
    flooded field farming, and industrial monocrop/plantation agriculture).\n\n"
