description: "According to the 'International Poverty Line' set by the United Nations
    people are considered to live in extreme poverty when living on less than 1.90
    international-$ per day. International $ are adjusted for price differences between
    countries and for price changes over time (inflation).\n\nThis visualization can
    be found in Ravallion (2016) – The Economics of Poverty: History, Measurement,
    and Policy. Oxford University Press. 28 January 2016. 736 Pages.\n\nWe have updated
    the visualization from Ravallion (2016) using the same sources the author relies
    on: Bourguignon and Morrison (2002) for the historical estimates and the World
    Bank for data from 1981 onwards. \n\nAll poverty estimates 1981 and later are
    taken from the World Bank's Povcal Net: iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/ (downloaded
    in February 2019).\nAll data from 1980 and earlier is taken from Bourguignon and
    Morrisson (2002) – Inequality Among World Citizens: 1820–1992. In American Economic
    Review, 92, 4, 727–748. Bourguignon and Morrisson (2002) state that 'the poverty
    lines were calibrated so that poverty and extreme poverty headcounts in 1992 coincided
    roughly with estimates from other sources’; here we rely on the midpoint of the
    two series published by Bourguignon and Morrison. \n\nThe absolute number of the
    world population is taken from the OurWorldInData world population data set: https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth. "
