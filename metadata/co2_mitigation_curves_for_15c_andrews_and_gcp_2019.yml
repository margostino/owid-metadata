name: co2_mitigation_curves_for_15c_andrews_and_gcp_2019
description: "Data denotes the range of CO2 mitigation curves for a range of 'start
    year scenarios': scenarios are based on the annual emission reductions necessary
    to keep global temperature rise below 1.5C if emissions mitigation was to start
    in a given year. \n\nFor example, 'Start in 2010' marks the necessary future emissions
    pathway to have a >66% chance of keeping global average temperatures below 1.5C
    warming if global CO2 emissions mitigation had started in 2010, very quickly peaking
    then falling. \n\nData is sourced from Robbie Andrew, and available for download
    here: http://folk.uio.no/roberan/t/global_mitigation_curves.shtml\n\nHistorical
    emissions to 2017 are sourced from CDIAC/Global Carbon Project, projection to
    2018 from Global Carbon Project (Le Quéré et al. 2018).\n\nGlobal cumulative CO2
    emissions budgets are from the IPCC Special Report on 1.5°C (Rogelj et al 2018):
    420 GtCO2 for a 66% of 1.5°C and 1170 GtCO2 for a 66% of 2°C. Mitigation curves
    describe approximately exponential decay pathways such that the quota is never
    exceeded (see Raupach et al., 2014)."
