description: "To calculate country exports to the rest of the world, the total value
    of exports by country, per year, is divided by the country's GDP. Calculations
    use Fouquin and Hugot (CEPII 2016) dyadic trade data.\n\nThe time series 'World'
    corresponds to the World's total exports (i.e. the sum of exports reported by
    all countries in the dataset).\n\nThe total export values of regional income aggregates
    have been calculated using the World Bank's income groupings.\n\nGermany's time
    series is comprised of West Germany, and Germany. East Germany has been excluded
    for the purposes of Germany's calculations but is included in the World series.\nRussia's
    time series comprises Russia and the USSR. \n\nContinental groupings are defined
    according to OWID's classification. Europe has been split into Western Europe
    including: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary,
    Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland,
    and the United Kingdom. Remaining European countries have been classified as Eastern
    Europe."
