description: "Data published by the Joint Center for History and Economics has been
    sourced from a range of authors and publications, referenced below.\r\n\r\nThe
    authors note:\r\n\r\n1. Firewood consumption has been calculated in a variety
    of ways by the various authors. Sometimes totals are not included for the later
    part of the series, even if IEA or other organizations report it. The same applies
    to other forms of energy such as incinerated waste products;\r\n\r\n2. this work
    considers as primary electricity the following sources: geothermal (only for electricity);
    hydropower, nuclear power, wind, photo­voltaics, tidals, wave and solar thermal
    (only for electricity). Generally electricity that has been derived from firewood,
    wastes, or other biomass is not included in ‘primary electricity’ as this entails
    thermal losses;\r\n\r\n3. non-energy uses of oil and natural gas are excluded
    from the totals.\r\n\r\nOriginal references:\r\n\r\nItaly: Malanima, Paolo, Energy
