name: year_of_last_recorded_wild_poliomyelitis_virus_who_gpei_2017
description: "In three countries polio remains endemic today: Afghanistan, Nigeria
    and Pakistan. \n\nSwitzerland's data point was missing in the original dataset
    and was obtained from the WHO (2017) time series dataset \"Reported Cases of Selected
    Vaccine Preventable Diseases (VPDs)\" which can be found under point \"3.1 Reported
    incidence time series\" here: http://www.who.int/immunization/monitoring_surveillance/data/en/
    \n\nSomalia was listed twice in the GPEI table, so again the WHO (2017) dataset
    cited above was consulted to make out which year was in fact the correct information.
    \n\nTimor's datapoint originally read \"pre 1985\" and was replaced with 1985
    for this visualization."
