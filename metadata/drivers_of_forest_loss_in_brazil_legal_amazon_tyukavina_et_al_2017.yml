description: |-
    The study quantifies types of forest disturbance and loss in the Brazilian Legal Amazon (BLA) using a sample-based approach from remotely sensed data.

    This quantifies not only complete deforestation drivers, but also temporary forest loss from natural disturbances, wildfires, flooding etc.
