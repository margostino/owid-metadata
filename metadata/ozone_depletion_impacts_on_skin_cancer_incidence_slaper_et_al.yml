description: "The authors modelled the number of excess skin cancer cases they would
    expect among fair-skinned populations in the United States and Northwest Europe
    as a result of stratospheric ozone depletion.\n\nThis was modelled for a scenario
    of no restrictions on ozone-depleting substances, where the authors assumed a
    3% annual increase in emissions of chloroflourocarbons (CFCs), halons and methyl
    chloroforms. \n\nThe Montreal Protocol scenario assumed a decline of five important
    ozone-depleting substances by 50% by the end of 1999 as agreed in the protocol
    in 1987.\n\nThe Copenhagen Amendment assumed the production of 21 ozone-depleting
    substances reduced to zero by the end of 1995."
