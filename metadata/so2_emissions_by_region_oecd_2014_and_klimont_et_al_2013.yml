description: |-
    For the period 1850-2000 we have used regional data aggregated in OECD (2014) report based on Clio Infra national emissions data. Clio Infra data is available online at: https://www.clio-infra.eu/
    Data for 2010 has been derived using figures from Klimont et al. (2013).
    Metrics of emissions are the same in both sources and based on methodology developed in Smith et al. (2011). This methodology estimates emissions based on energy and industrial production and mass-balance statistics.
