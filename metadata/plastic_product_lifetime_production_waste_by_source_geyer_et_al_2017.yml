name: plastic_product_lifetime_production_waste_by_source_geyer_et_al_2017
description: "Data is given as mean product lifetimes of plastic products (measured
    in years), plastic production, and plastic waste by industrial sector/use (measured
    in tonnes per year). \n\nData is also given for primary production and plastic
    waste by polymer type. Polymer types are as follows:\n- LDPE: Low-density polyethylene\n-
    HDPE: High-density polyethylene\n- PP: Polypropylene\n- PS: Polystyrene\n- PVC:
    Polyvinyl chloride\n- PET: Polyethylene terephthalate\n- PUT: Polyurethanes\n-
    PP&A fibres: polyester, polyamide, and acrylic fibres\n- Other polymers\n- Additives"
