description: "Data is that of version 12 of Gapminder, the latest version as of 2019.
    This is the full fertility rate dataset published by Gapminder.\n\nGapminder's
    sources and methodology if well-documented in its dataset at: https://www.gapminder.org/data/\n\nIt
    notes its data sources during three key periods of time:\n\n— 1800 to 1950 (and
    in some cases also years after 1950): Gapminder v6 which were compiled and documented
    by Mattias Lindgren.\n\n— 1950 to 2014: In most cases we use the latest UN estimates
    from World Population Prospects 2017 published in the file with Annually interpolated
    demographic indicators, called WPP2017_INT_F01_ANNUAL_DEMOGRAPHIC_INDICATORS.xlsx
    , accessed on September 2, 2017.\n\n— 2015 – 2099: We use the UN forecast of future
    fertility rate in all countries, called median fertility variant.\n\nVersion 12
    of the dataset extends back to the year 1800. Version 6 of Gapminder's fertility
    series includes data for a few countries further than 1800. We have included more
    historic data from Version 6 for Finland, the United Kingdom and Sweden. All data
    from 1800 onwards is from Version 12; data from pre-1800 is from Version 6.\n\nThere
    are significant uncertainties in data for many countries pre-1950. To develop
    full series back to 1800 for all countries, Gapminder combines published estimates
    within the academic literature and national statistics, with their own guesstimates
    and extrapolations for countries without published estimates. This series presents
    the selective Gapminder dataset: we have removed data points which were estimated
    by Gapminder with high uncertainty and instead only include those from published
    sources or the United Nations dataset. \n\nWe also publish the full dataset from
    Gapminder for users looking for a complete series. However, we should highlight
    that some of these estimates have a high degree of uncertainty. This dataset can
