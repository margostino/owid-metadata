name: total_economy_productivity_growth_oecd
description: "Data reports the annual growth rate (%) in productivity, measured as
    gross domestic product (GDP) per hour worked across all sectors of the economy.
    Percentage growth data is derived from underlying productivity data measured in
    2010 USD PPP. \n\nThe OECD note: \"Productivity is a key driver of economic growth
    and changes in living standards. Labour productivity growth implies a higher level
    of output for unit of labour input (hours worked or persons employed). This can
    be achieved if more capital is used in production or through improved overall
    efficiency with which labour and capital are used together, i.e., higher multifactor
    productivity growth (MFP). Productivity is also a key driver of international
    competitiveness, e.g. as measured by Unit Labour Costs (ULC).\""
