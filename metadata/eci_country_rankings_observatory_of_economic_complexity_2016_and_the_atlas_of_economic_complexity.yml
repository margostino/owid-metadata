description: "The Economic Complexity Index takes data on exports, and reduces a country’s
    economic system into two dimensions: (i) The number or ‘diversification’ of products
    in the export basket, and (ii) the quality, or ‘ubiquity’ of products in the export
    basket.\r\n\r\nTo measure these two dimensions, the ECI uses a cross-country export
    matrix. That is, a table with countries in the rows and product categories in
    the columns, so that each cell in the table shows the value of country-product
    exports.\r\n\r\nFrom this matrix, ‘diversification’ is obtained from the distribution
    of country exports across products (i.e. the sum across columns for each row);
    while ‘ubiquity’  is given by the share of product exports contributed by each
    country (i.e. the sum across rows for each column).\r\n\r\nTo condense both dimensions
    into a single metric, the ECI further reduces the information in the matrix, such
    that countries with similar exports are close together in the ranking. \r\n\r\nLoosely
    speaking, lower ECI scores correspond to countries that export very few different
    types of products (i.e. export baskets that are not diversified) and those products
    that they do export are produced in many other countries (i.e. export baskets
    that load heavily on just a few ubiquitous products). \r\n\r\nBy this logic, Germany
    has a high ECI score because it exports many different kinds of sophisticated
    things that are only produced by a handful of other countries with similarly diversified
    productive capacities. \r\n\r\nThe following visualization shows ECI rankings
    for all countries in the world. Link: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/economic-complexity-rankings\r\n\r\nAs
    we can see, there is a clear pattern – richer countries tend to have similar economic
    structures, and these structures allow them to produce and export a varied basket
    of sophisticated products.\r\n\r\nBut what about countries endowed with rare natural
    resources, like petroleum, which would make a country’s export basket less ubiquitous,
    and hence misleadingly be assigned a more favourable ECI ranking? If a country
    exporting petroleum can only produce a few other products, then the low ubiquity
    for their export basket can be explained by these natural resources, and the ECI
    ranking is corrected by the country’s inability to produce different types of
    products. However, if this country can also produce a diverse range of other goods,
    then low ubiquity correctly indicates greater economic complexity which is reflected
    in the ranking. Hence, information on diversity can correct for the information
    of ubiquity, and vice versa.\r\n\r\nThe data here comes from the Economic Complexity
    Index scores published by the MIT Observatory of Economic Complexity. These are
    different to those published by the Harvard Atlas of Economic Complexity. As far
    as we are aware, the discrepancies stem from differences in the way each sources
    clean the underlying cross-country trade data. You can explore differences between
    these two data sources here: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/eci-country-rankings-comparison?country=KOR.\r\n"
