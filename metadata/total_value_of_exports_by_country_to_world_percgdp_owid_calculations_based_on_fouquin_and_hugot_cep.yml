description: "Whenever possible, the source reports data on merchandise trade, excluding
    trade in services and re-exports. Some specific goods are also excluded (the authors
    highlight the omission of bullion and species in historical data).\n\nSince re-exports
    are excluded, special import data is favored over general import data (special
    imports have the importing country as their final destination, whereas general
    trade is composed of special trade, together with transit trade).\n\nTo calculate
    total exports to the rest of the world as a share of GDP, using the UK as an example,
    figures have been calculated as follows:\n\nUK-exports-to-the-world-as-share-of-GDP
    = [exports-to-A + exports-to-B + exports-to-C] / GDP-of-UK (this calculation would
    assume there are a total of three countries in the entire sample constituting
    the rest of the world).\n\nExport values used rely on the estimate given by the
    importer as the authors note: \"importers have a greater incentive to properly
    assess trade flows as they are commonly subject to duties\". Bilateral trade flows
    are recorded in current British pounds.\n\n Fouquin and Hugot (CEPII 2016) data
    uses the IMF's Direction of Trade Statistics (DOTS) dataset extensively from 1948
    until the present day.\n\nWest Germany estimates have been used between 1950 -
    1990, and Germany's trade estimates used before 1950 and after 1990. Estimates
    for East Germany have been excluded. Please see the original document providing
    a detailed description of the data set used, including country and territory definitions,
    available at: http://www.cepii.fr/CEPII/fr/publications/wp/abstract.asp?NoDoc=9134\n\nMicronesia,
    Marshall Islands, Monaco, Montenegro, San Marino, and the Bahamas have also been
    excluded from the sample due to insufficient data availability. "
