description: "The increase in life expectancy in 1955 was calculated as follows: Life
    expectancy in 1955 minus life expectancy in 1950 provides the total increase in
    life expectancy across this five year interval (x). The increase in life expectancy
    in hours per day is given by x multiplied by 365 divided by 5x365. This total
    is then multiplied by 24. The increase in life expectancy in months per year is
    given by x divided by 5, multiplied by 12.\r\n\r\nThe increase in life expectancy
    between 1950-2015 has been calculated as follows: Life expectancy in 2015 minus
    life expectancy in 1950 provides the total increase in years over the 65 year
    interval (y). The increase in life expectancy in hours per day is given by y multiplied
    by 365 divided by 65x365. This total is then multiplied by 24. "
