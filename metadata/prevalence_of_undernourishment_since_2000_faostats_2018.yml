name: prevalence_of_undernourishment_since_2000_faostats_2018
description: |-
    Estimated prevalence and total number of undernourished individuals as reported by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).

    Data is based on its latest statistics on FAOstats (http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FS). This data extends from the year 2000 through to 2016 at national levels, and 2017 estimates by region and at the global level.

    Figures at the national level are reported as 3-year averages; here we have allocated these figures to the mid-year. For example, the UN FAO reports national data for "2014-2016" which we allocate to the year 2015.

    Some data, particularly for high-income countries, is not reported by the UN FAO. This is often the case for countries where the prevalence of undernourishment is less than 2.5% of the total population.

    The categories of Extreme Fragility and Fragile have been added as a variable based on the country groupings defined in the OECD's States of Fragility (2018) Report.
