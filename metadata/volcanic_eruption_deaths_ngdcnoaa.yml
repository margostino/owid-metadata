description: "Data represents the estimated number of deaths from volcanic eruption
    events. This includes direct deaths from volcanic eruptions, in addition to secondary
    impacts (such as a tsunami or earthquake triggered by an eruption).\n\nOur World
    in Data have aggregated significant earthquake numbers by country/location per
    year. \n\nDue to data availability, reporting and evidence, it's expected that
    more recent data will be more complete than the long historical record."
