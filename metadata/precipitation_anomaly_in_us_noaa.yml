name: precipitation_anomaly_in_us_noaa
description: "Data shows US precipitation patterns, based on rainfall and snowfall
    measurements from land-based weather stations worldwide. \n\nThis indicator shows
    annual anomalies, or differences, compared with the average precipitation from
    1901 to 2000. At each weather station, annual precipitation anomalies were calculated
    from total annual precipitation in inches. Anomalies for the contiguous 48 states
    and Alaska have been determined by calculating average precipitation anomalies
    for areas within each state based on station density and topography. These regional
    anomalies are then averaged together in proportion to their area to develop national
    results."
