name: conflict_and_terrorism_deaths_owid_based_on_ihme_and_gtd
description: "Data for conflict and terrorism deaths has been differentiated by Our
    World in Data based on published figures by the IHME, Global Burden of Disease
    (GBD), and Global Terrorism Database (GTD).\n\nThe IHME, GBD report combined deaths
    from 'Conflict and Terrorism'. To differentiate 'conflict' deaths, we have subtracted
    number of terrorism deaths published by the GTD from this combined metric of 'Conflict
    and Terrorism'. \n\nWe have also calculated both of these individual parameters
    in terms of the percentage of total deaths, by dividing by IHME figures of deaths
    for 'All causes'.\n\nNote that in some cases, estimates of homicide, conflict
    and terrorism can be challenging to differentiate, with different estimates from
    different sources and definitions. For terrorism, we have used data from the GTD;
    full data and definitions can be found at our entry: www.ourworldindata.org/terrorism\n\nSources:\nIHME,
