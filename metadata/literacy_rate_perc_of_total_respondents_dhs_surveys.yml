description: "The adult literacy rate is defined as the percentage of survey respondents,
    aged 15 and above, who can read. The 155 literacy variable indicates whether a
    respondent who attended primary schooling can read a whole or part of a sentence
    showed. A respondent who attended secondary education or higher are coded 2 as
    well as respondent who could read a whole sentence. Possible categories include:
    0 - cannot read at all; 1 - able to read only parts of sentence; 2 - able to read
    whole sentence; 3 - no card with required language; 4 - blind/visually impaired.
    Our estimates exclude those in categories 3 and 4. \n\nThe methodology for constructing
    this variable is as follows:\n<ul>\n<li>The DHS surveys for men and women were
    pooled</li>\n<li>Created a dichotomous literacy variable, combining categories
    1 'able to read only parts of sentence' with 2 'able to read whole sentence' to
    represent literate respondents, and 0 'cannot read at all' for illiterate respondents</li>\n<li>Summed
    the total number of respondents who were classified as literate and the total
    number of respondents, for each country in each year</li>\n<li>Calculated the
    literacy rate (% of total respondents) = (number of people in category 1 and 2
    / number of respondents) * 100 </li>\n<li>Calculated the female literacy rate
    (% of total respondents) = (number of females in category 1 and 2 / number of
    respondents) * 100 </li>\n<li>Calculated the male literacy rate (% of total respondents)
    = (number of males in category 1 and 2 / number of respondents) * 100 </li>\n</ul>\n\nThe
    number of survey respondents varies from country-to-country and year-to-year.
    Therefore, comparisons across countries should be made with caution. \n\nDHS surveys
    are conducted approximately every 5 years in phases. The literacy variable (155)
    is available from phase 4 onward. Hence, Phase 7 corresponds to 2015; phase 6
    to 2010; phase 5 to 2005; and phase 4 to 2000.  As this dataset brings together
    a number of countries across various phases, the year has been assigned according
    to the survey phase. Note the actual year the survey was conducted in a country
    may differ to the year assigned, but the survey will have been undertaken within
    the five year interval between each phase. \n\nFor further information on the
