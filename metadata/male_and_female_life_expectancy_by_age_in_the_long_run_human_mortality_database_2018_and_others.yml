    US estimates are based on Hacker (2010) for the period 1780 to 1890. The year 1790 refers to the period 1790-99; see Table 8: New Life Tables for the White Population of the United States, 1780-1900 for the original data consulted for this period. The US Social Security Administration data is used from 1900 to today.

    For other countries,  estimates are based on the Human Mortality Database period tables. Following <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w24716" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Goldin and Lleras-Muney (2018)</a>, our data covers only years in which a census was undertaken. Goldin and Lleras-Muney (2018) explain: "census data are available every ten years starting in 1841 for England, and every ten years starting in 1860 for Sweden. For France they occurred every 5 years between 1836 and 1936 (except for 1871 which was held in 1872, and for 1916 which was cancelled) and then for 1946, 1962, 1968, 1975, 1982, 1990 and 1999."

    Note: the United Kingdom refers to the total population of England and Wales.
