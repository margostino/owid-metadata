description: "Data denotes the global warming potential (GWP) over a 100-year timescale
    for greenhouse gases relative to the GWP of carbon dioxide (which is denoted as
    1). Global warming potential measures the relative warming impact of one unit
    mass of gas relative to one unit of carbon dioxide. For example, a GWP value for
    gas 'x' of 25 would mean one tonne of 'x' would have 25 times the warming impact
    of one tonne of carbon dioixde.\n\nGWP100 values are used to convert greenhouse
    gases into a carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) metric by multiplying emissions
    in mass terms by their respective GWP100 factors.\n\nIn the IPCC's 5th Assessment
    Report (AR5), it presents GWP both with and without climate change feedback effects.
    For some gases, for example methane, this can introduce significant uncertainty.
    In the case of methane, the GWP100 value without feedbacks is 28; with feedbacks
    this increases to 34. \n\nIn its official figures the IPCC adopts GWP100 factors
    without climate change feedbacks. Here we present the same figures without climate
    change feedbacks to maintain consistency with the IPCC."
