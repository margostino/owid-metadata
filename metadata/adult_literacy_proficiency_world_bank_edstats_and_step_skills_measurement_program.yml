description: "To calculate the average score in adult literacy proficiency from the
    STEP surveys we have: \n<ul>\n<li>Calculated the mean literacy score for each
    individual in the survey (over 10 plausible value scores)</li>\n<li>Taken the
    sum of the mean literacy scores over all individuals</li>\n<li>Divided the aggregate
    literacy score by the number of individuals</li>\n</ul>\nThe STEP data for calculated
    average adult literacy (8 additional observations) is appended to the PIAAC scores
    from World Bank EdStats dataset. \n8 STEP observations include: Armenia (2013);
    Bolivia (2012); Colombia (2012); Georgia (2013); Ghana (2013); Kenya (2013); Ukraine
    (2012); and Vietnam (2012)\n\nAs the STEP methodology note outlines \"The STEP
    literacy assessment has been developed specifically for use in the context of
    developing countries, and it includes sets of questions taken from PIAAC, the
    International Adult Literacy Survey, and the Adult Literacy and Life Skills Survey.
    This overlap allows countries participating in the STEP program to compare their
    literacy results with those of over 30 other countries.\"\nFull citation: “Pierre,
