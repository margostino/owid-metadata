description: "Youth Mortality Rate measures the share of newborns who die before reaching
    the age of 15. \n\nThis dataset was constructed by Our World in Data based on
    data from the United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation
    (UN IGME).\n\nWe define and calculate 'youth mortality' based on the combination
    of:\n- under-5 mortality rates (the share of newborns who die before reaching
    the age of five)\n-  5-14 mortality rates (the share of children aged 5 who die
    before reaching the age of 15).\n\nBoth of these metrics are available from the
    UN IGME. Based on these estimates we calculate 'youth mortality': the share of
    newborns who die before reaching the age of 15."
