description: "The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) database reports the absolute number
    of deaths across mortality cause and risk factors for any given year.\r\nIt is
    important to understand the distinction between risk factors and causes of deaths.
    Causes of deaths are defined by the OECD as: \"the underlying cause of death refers
    to the disease or injury that initiated the train of morbid events leading directly
    to death or the circumstances of the accident or violence that produced the injury.\"
    Causes of deaths therefore include particular events such as road accidents, natural
    disasters, drowning, HIV/AIDS, and non-communicable diseases such as diabetes,
    and various cancers.\r\nRisk factors are particular behaviors or lifestyle factors
    which affect the probability of incidence of particular diseases and causes of
    death. For example, tobacco smoking is a risk factor which increases the probability
    of lung cancer. In this case, it is not tobacco smoking in itself which is the
    cause of death, but the increased incidence of lung cancer.\r\nIn order to identify
    and highlight the specific behaviours, lifestyle factors - and thereby the potential
    intervention points for prevention of mortality - this data presents a mix of
    causes of death and risk factors. Many of the variables are straightforward causes
    of death - such as road accidents, drowning, fire, malaria, terrorism fatalities.
    However, for non-communicable diseases such as stroke, cancer, diabetes, which
    can form a complex combination of preceding behaviour and lifestyle factors we
    have instead presented the IHME's attributed figures by risk factors, including
    high blood pressure, obesity, high blood sugar & tobacco smoking. Identification
    of these factors is more conducive to highlighting the specific behaviours or
    preventative factors which can be addressed in order to improve health outcomes
    and reduce mortality rates.\r\nCauses and risk factors are further clarified as
    follows:\r\n'Outdoor air pollution' refers to outdoor/ambient exposure to particulate
    matter (PM) and ozone.\r\n'Drug use' refers to the use of cannabis, opioids, or
    amphetamines, or use of injecting drugs [does not include tobacco or alcohol].
    This is distinguished from 'drug disorders' which refers to direct death as a
    result of drug dependence and drug abuse.\r\n'Alcohol disorders' refers to death
    as a result of alcohol dependence and alcohol abuse; this is distinguishable from
    'alcohol use', which is premature death as a result of general alcohol consumption
    which is linked to increased risk of certain diseases.\r\n'Road accidents' includes
    deaths from all road vehicles, including drivers, passengers, pedestrians and
    cyclists.\r\n\r\n'Nutritional deficiencies' are defined as protein-energy malnutrition,
    iodine, vitamin-A, and iron deficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
