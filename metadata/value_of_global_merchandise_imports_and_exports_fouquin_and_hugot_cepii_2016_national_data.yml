description: "To calculate country exports (imports) to (from) the rest of the world,
    the total value of exports (imports) by country, per year, is divided by the country's
    GDP. Calculations use Fouquin and Hugot (CEPII 2016) national trade data.\n\nThe
    time series 'World' corresponds to the World's total exports (imports) (i.e. the
    sum of exports (imports) reported by all countries in the dataset).\n\nThe total
    export (import) values of regional income aggregates have been calculated using
    the World Bank's income groupings. These time series begin in 1970, where the
    number of countries are more representative. Similarly, total export (import)
    values by continental grouping begin in 1960. \n\nGermany's time series is comprised
    of West Germany, and Germany. East Germany has been excluded for the purposes
    of Germany's calculations.\nRussia's time series comprises Russia and the USSR. "
