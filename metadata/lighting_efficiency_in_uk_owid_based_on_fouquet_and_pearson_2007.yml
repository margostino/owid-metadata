name: lighting_efficiency_in_uk_owid_based_on_fouquet_and_pearson_2007
description: |-
    Data was calculated by OWID based on published figures by Fouquet & Pearson (2006). Calculated as the weighted-average efficiency of lighting in the United Kingdom. Calculated based on percentage share and efficiency data of lighting sources from Fouquet & Pearson (2006). Data represents the national average efficiency, calculated as the sum of (% share * efficiency) of each source.

    For example: (share of lighting from candles * efficiency of candles) + (share of lighting from whale oil * efficiency of whale oil) + (share of lighting from kerosene * efficiency of kerosene).

    Efficiency is measured in lumen-hours per kilowatt-hour.
