description: 'To construct this chart we started from a dataset with dyadic trade
    estimates. For each year we took all country pairs with data and classified them
    as follows: "Non-trading" (pairs in which countries do not trade with one another);
    "Bilateral" (pairs in which both countries export to one another); and "Unilateral"
    (pairs in which only one country exports to the other).'
