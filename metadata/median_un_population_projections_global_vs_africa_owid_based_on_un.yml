description: |-
    Population data is based on the Medium UN projection (2017 Edition) from 2015-2100. This is presented in thousands.

    Our World in Data have derived the age category "12-24 years old" based on the sum of the UN age cohorts "12-14" and "15-24" years old. OWID have also derived a value for all non-African countries, using the global projection minus the population projection for Africa.
