description: "The UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) collects cross-national education
    statistics. Data on literacy rates come from a variety of sources (such as national
    censuses and surveys) and reporting modes (self-reporting vs household declarations).
    \r\n\r\nData instruments used to estimate literacy are grouped under three main
    types: i) a census; ii) a survey; or iii) indirect estimates. Indirect estimates
    are extrapolated - based on educational attainment, or estimated based on the
    country's census.\r\n\r\nMethodologies used for measuring literacy have been grouped
    into four categories: household declarations, self declarations, literacy tests,
    and national estimates. Both household and self-declared literacy are self-reports;
    in the former, it is the head of the household responding to the survey, and in
    the latter it is directly reported by the individuals themselves.\r\n\r\nUNESCO
    categorised Chile's (2009) and the Philippines' (2003) mode of literacy reporting
    as 'Household/Self declaration'. We have categorised the two countries under the
    household declaration category."
