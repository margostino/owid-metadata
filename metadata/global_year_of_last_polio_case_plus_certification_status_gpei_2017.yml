description: "The definition of WHO Regions can be found here: http://www.who.int/about/regions/en/
    \n\nBecause the certification of being polio-free is done by the WHO by region
    and not by country (and only three years after the last case of polio was recorded),
    you see three polio statuses: endemic, polio-free (WHO Region not yet certified)
    and polio-free with the WHO Region of the country also certified polio-free."
