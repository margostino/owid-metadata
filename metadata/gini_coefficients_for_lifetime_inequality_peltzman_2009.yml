description: "Sent in by Sam Peltzman, who uses this data in his paper “Mortality
    Inequality”, Journal of Economic Perspectives 23(4), Fall 2009: 175-190.\r\n\r\nLife
    tables defined by Peltzman (2009) \"lists the number of survivors at each age
    from a hypothetical birth (age=0) cohort of 100,000.\" The life table data is
    compiled from two online databases: www.mortality.org developed by researchers
    at the University of California Berkeley and the Data Laboratory of the Max Planck
    Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, Germany. The http://www.lifetable.de/
    data was put together by researchers from these two institutions and the researchers
    from the Institut national d'etudes demographiques in Paris, France."
