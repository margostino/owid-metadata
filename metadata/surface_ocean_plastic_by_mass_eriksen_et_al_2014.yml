description: "Estimates by Eriksen et al. (2014) on the mass of surface ocean debris
    floating at sea, differentiated by ocean basin and particle size.\n\nParticle
    size categories range from small microplastics to macroplastics. \n\nEstimates
    are based on results from 24 expeditions (over the period 2007–2013) across all
    five sub-tropical gyres, costal Australia, Bay of Bengal and the Mediterranean
    Sea conducting surface net tows (N = 680) and visual survey transects of large
    plastic debris (N = 891). These field-based results were combined with oceanographic
    modelling of floating debris dispersal and wind-driven vertical mixing to derive
    total oceanic figures."
