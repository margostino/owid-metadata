description: "Average per capita fossil fuel production - for coal, oil and gas -
    was calculated by OWID based on published population and national fossil fuel
    production data.\r\n\r\nPer capita fossil fuel production was calculated by dividing
    national production of coal, oil or gas by the total population in any given year.\r\n\r\nPopulation
    data was sourced from a combination of Gapminder sources (for data pre-1950),
    and from 1950 onwards was sourced from the UN Population Division's 2017 Revision.\r\n\r\nFossil
    fuel production data was sourced from a combination of sources.\r\n\r\nGlobal
    data from 1800-1965 was sourced from Vaclav Smil's Updated and Revised Edition
    of his book, 'Energy Transitions: Global and National Perspectives' (2017). This
    book can be found on Smil's website at: http://vaclavsmil.com/2016/12/14/energy-transitions-global-and-national-perspectives-second-expanded-and-updated-edition/.\r\n\r\nGlobal
    data from 1965 onwards was sourced from BP Statistical Review of Global Energy.

    at the national and regional level is sourced from The SHIFT Project Data Portal,
    who draws upon Etemad & Luciana and US IEA Historical Statistics. Available at:

    data on UK coal output was sourced from the UK's Department for Energy and Climate
    Change (DECC). Historical coal data: coal production, availability and consumption
    1853 to 2016. Available at: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/historical-coal-data-coal-production-availability-and-consumption-1853-to-2011
