    ODA: The DAC defines ODA as â€œthose flows to countries and territories on the DAC List of ODA Recipients
    and to multilateral institutions which are:
    i) provided by official agencies, including state and local governments, or by their executive
    agencies; and
    ii) each transaction is administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective; and is concessional in character and conveys a grant element of at least 25 per cent (calculated at a rate of discount of 10 per cent).
