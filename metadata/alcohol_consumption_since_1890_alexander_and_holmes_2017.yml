name: alcohol_consumption_since_1890_alexander_and_holmes_2017
description: "Average per capita alcohol consumption in select high-income countries
    from 1890 to 2014. \n\nThis is given as the average per capita level of consumption
    (not level per average adult); it may therefore not be directly comparable with
    modern statistics of per capita consumption for populations 15+ years.\n\nEstimates
    in the original paper are given for particular decades e.g. \"1920s\", \"1940s\".
    For this dataset we have allocated this figure to the first year in this period
    e.g. 1920 and 1940.\n\n"
