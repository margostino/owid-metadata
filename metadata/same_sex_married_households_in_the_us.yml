description: 'The series includes data for the period 2005-2008, but these estimates
    are not comparable to those for the period 2008-2018. This is because of changes
    in the survey questionnaires. The source notes: "Changes in the questionnaire
    format and data capture procedures between 2007 and 2008 resulted in significant
    declines in the estimated number of same-sex partner households in 2008. For more
    explanation, see the following working paper: https://www.census.gov/library/working-papers/2010/demo/oconnell-01.html"'
