description: "Shen et al. (2018) compared the leading causes of death in the United
    States as their share of total deaths relative to Google searches and media coverage
    in The New York Times (NYT) and The Guardian newspaper. For this analysis they
    selected the top 10 causes of death in the USA in addition to terrorism, homicide,
    and drug overdoses (which they assumed to also receive significant media attention).\n\nData
    each causes' share of total deaths in the USA was assessed based on the Centers
    for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) WONDER database for public health, available
    at: https://wonder.cdc.gov/. This is available from 1999 to 2016. Combined, the
    13 causes of death assessed in this analysis account for approximately 88% of
    all deaths in the USA.\n\nData on Google searches was derived from Google Trends
    (available from 2004 to 2016). This was assessed on the number of searches for
    these terms and close synonyms.\n\nThe New York Times and The Guardian media coverage
    was assessed from both newspapers' article databases. Here the authors searched
    the database for a list of all articles which contained the word anywhere (headline
    or body).\n\nAll values are normalized to 100% so they represent their relative
    share of the top causes, rather than absolute \ncounts (e.g. ‘deaths’ represents
    each causes’ share of deaths within the 13 categories shown rather than total
    deaths). This allows for us to compare the relative representation of different
    sources.\n\nFull methodology, notes and open-access data on GitHub are available
    from the original source: https://owenshen24.github.io/charting-death/."
