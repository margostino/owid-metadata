description: "Data was compiled by Our World in Data based on a number of historical
    sources. Data is based on best estimates: there is greater uncertainty in earlier
    historical data but is provided as the best estimate of the time. \n\nThe main
    data source for rhino populations is the African and Asian Rhino Specialist Groups
    (AfRSG). AfRSG periodically produce the latest estimates of rhino populations
    in Africa and Asia, in update reports of their status. The available literature
    from AfRSG can be accessed at: http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/index.php?s=1&act=refs.\n\nCitation
    of the latest report is as follows:\nEmslie, R.H. et al., 2019. African and Asian
    rhinoceroses - status, conservation and trade. A report from the IUCN Species
    Survival Commission (IUCN/SSC) African and Asian Rhino Specialist Groups and TRAFFIC

    here estimates from AfRSG is available, we have used its data. However, we have
    also combined these statistics with earlier estimates from multiple academic sources.
