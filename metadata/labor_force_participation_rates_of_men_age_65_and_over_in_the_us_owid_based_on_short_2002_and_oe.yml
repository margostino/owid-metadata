description: "The source for the period 1880 to 1990 is Short, Joanna (2002) – “Economic
    History of Retirement in the United States”. EH.Net Encyclopedia, edited by Robert
    Whaples. September 30, 2002. URL http://eh.net/encyclopedia/economic-history-of-retirement-in-the-united-states/\n\nThis
    data is based on these three sources: \n– Moen, Jon R. Essays on the Labor Force
    and Labor Force Participation Rates: The United States from 1860 through 1950.
    Ph.D. dissertation, University of Chicago, 1987.\n– Costa, Dora L. The Evolution
    of Retirement: An American Economic History, 1880-1990. Chicago: University of
    Chicago Press, 1998.\n– Bureau of Labor Statistics \n\nData for 2000 to 2015 is
    from the OECD [OECD.stat web browser – Source: http://stats.oecd.org/viewhtml.aspx?datasetcode=LFS_SEXAGE_I_R&lang=en
    Labor force participation of men 65 and older from the OECD – http://stats.oecd.org/viewhtml.aspx?datasetcode=LFS_SEXAGE_I_R&lang=en]\"\n\nData
    for 2000 is available from both sources and the discrepancy is minor so that we
    decided to merge the data as presented in the sources. Short reports 17.5% while
    the OECD reports 17.73% for 2000."
